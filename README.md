# Imperator: Invictus
How to play the dev-versions: Download this program: https://desktop.github.com/ and install it Once installed open it and press clone new repo, go to the url tab and put in this: https://github.com/SnowletTV/Invictus.git Then for the location, change it to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod(modname) (navigate it yourself and make sure it doesn't get put in a subfolder)!!!don't use capitilization in the name and manually verify the local path!!! and then press clone. Next go to the branch as seen in the screenshot and select the dev branch, when you want to update press the button next to it to fetch origin twice as we often update the github, now finally copy over the .mod file attached here. Put it into the Imperator/mod folder where the other .mod files are, you should now be able to add the mod to a playset and see if it works
