How to use the github-version.
Unsubscribe from the steamworkshop/pdx store version
Download this program: https://desktop.github.com/ and install it
Once installed open it and press clone new repo, go to the url tab and put in this: Invictus: https://github.com/SnowletTV/Invictus.git

Then for the location, change it to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\invictus (navigate it yourself and make sure it doesn't get put in a subfolder)!
don't use capitalization in the name and manually verify the local path!!! and then press clone.
Next go to the branch and select the dev branch, when you want to update press the button next to it to fetch origin twice as we often update the branch, now finally copy over the .mod file you downloaded from our Discord: https://discord.gg/5K9fd3qSjx.  
Put it into the Imperator/mod folder where other .mod files are, you should now be able to add the mod to a playset and see if it works.
