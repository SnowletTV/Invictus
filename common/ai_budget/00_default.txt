#AI scriptable budget logic.
#
#Logic: For each type of game currency (e.g. gold), there can be several constraints on how much the AI wants to spend in a particular expense cateogry.
#
#There are two sets of tracked values per category: Expenditures so far (exponentially decaying by NDefines::NAI::EXPENDITURE_DECAY_FACTOR) and budget allowance.
#There is also a category representing savings. It is merely used to hold money temporarily, you can by modifying targets modulate this.
#
#When checking if money can be used for something: spendable money = treasury - savings
#
#if spendable money > sum(allowances) - savings: <=> if treasury > sum(allowances):
#	reserves = spendable - (sum(allowances) - savings) = treasury - savings - sum(allowances) + savings = treasury - sum(allowances)
#	look at decaying expenditures to figure out how to assign excess reserves:
#		A(x) = actual part of expenditures for category x
#		T(x) = target part of expenditures for category x
#		W(x) = raw reserve weight for category x
#		K = NDefines::NAI::EXPENDITURE_SOFT_FACTOR / numcategories
#
#		W(x) = (K + T(x)) / (K + A(x))
#
#		Normalized W(x) (N(x), so that sum(N) = 1) is then subject to expense constraints.
#
#AI is allowed to schedule expense in category x if allowance(x) >= 0. Upon spending in category x, allowance(x) is subtracted and decaying_expenditures(x)
#added to a corresponding amount.
#
#What makes life non-trivial is circular dependencies. For instance, what happens if all expenditure categories are marked as overspent?
#What happens if all but one category are marked as overspent, and external logic is refusing to spend?
#
#The meaning of categories depends on the constraint used. Most commonly it applies to the sum of all sub-categories of the category, though.
#
#Constraints are evaluated as follows (in order of decreasing priority):
#Minimums. The largest minimum applies.
#Maximums. The smallest maximum applies.

#In script arithmetic, remember that min/max are inverted as binary operations. E.g. max is to be interpreted as "maximum/ceiling value" and not "the largest of the inputs".
