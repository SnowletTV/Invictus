#Hurrian pantheon
# Nabarbi, "she of Nawar"
# Hurrian word for lord "ewri", female equivalent "allai". Seems to be King/Queen (along with the tigris and euphrates in the hittite story)"
# Allani “the Lady (of the Netherworld)”
# Hutena “Those of favoring”
# Hutelluri “midwife”
# Mušuni “(She) of justice”
# Ebrimuša “the Lord of justice”
# Ša(w)uška “the Great”;
# Tiyabenti “(he/she) who speaks favorably."
# Nabarbi “(She) of Nawar.”
# Urartian Teišeba (of Qumenu)
# Nubadig (Tišatal: Lubadag)
# A goddess of eastern origin who occupied a position of a certain importance in the West Hurrian pantheon is the Elamite Pirinki/ar: a type of Ištar.4
# Sumuqan of Gurta (mentioned in passing from mitanni, might not be hurrian)
# Pardahi of Šuda
#The Hurrians received Hebat from the local cult: she had been the consort of the Storm God Hadda of Halab at least from the twenty-seventh century.5
#Teššub is followed by six major gods:
# Tašmišu (his “pure brother”), Kumarbi, Kušuh, Šimeki, Aštabi, Nubadig
#Ea (Hayya) is a Babylonian god. Hurrian texts attribute to this god the Akkadian epithet: “lord of wisdom,”
#Men on the left, women on right, all male gods except Ea are hurrian. Females largely nonhurrian?
#Teššub / IM / U ~ Hebat
#Tašmišu / Hitt. Šuwaliyat Ø
#Kumarbi / NISABA (= Dagan) / EN.LÍL ~ NIN.LÍL
#É.A (Hayya) ~ Damkina (DAM.KI.NA)
#Kušuh / 30 / EN.ZU (Sîn) ~ Nikkal (NIN.GAL)
#Šimegi / UTU ~ Aya (A.A) (- Ekaldu)52
#Aštabi / NIN.URTA
#Nubadig
#Nikkal (NIN.GAL) holds an important position in the Hurrian pantheon,58 since her cult was already widespread in Syria. It reached Mari as early as the last century of the third millennium,59 and, further, Ugarit
#The Hurrian documents from Ugarit have not only the couple Kušuh Nikkal, but also Umbu (’Ib)—Nikkal, as in the Hurrian-Hittite texts.60 Umbu is another name for the moon received by the Hurrians.61
#The Hurrians gave the names Šerri(š) and Hurri to the two bulls who drew the chariot of the Storm God
#In the Hedammu and Ullikummi myths (as well as in other fragmentary documents of the Kumarbi cycle) his vizier is Mukišanu, whose name is derived from Mukiš, the region of the city of Alalah
#Some deities already belonged to the pantheon of people of Semitic language settled in Syria already in the third millennium b.c.e., as the documents from Ebla have revealed.79 Among them there are Adamma; Aštabi(l); Hebat;80 Išhara; Rašap
#Names such as Adamma, Aštabil, Kubaba, and Šalaš are in any case hardly Semitic. 
#in the Hurrian pantheon from Kizzuwatna she (Adamma) forms a dyad with Kubaba
#Kubaba does not appear, instead, in the Ebla text, although she is attested as the goddess of Karkamiš already from the eighteenth century
#The cult of d Áš/Aš-da-bíl was fairly widespread in the period of Ebla. This name is written d Aš-ta/da-(a)-bi at Hattuša and Alalah (a month name), Aštb in the Hurrian god lists of Ugarit. In the Hurro-Hittite texts he is considered a warrior god. The writing d Aš-ta-bí-il, attested in three documents from eighteenth-century Mari, confirms that the name ended originally in -l
#El is a figure created in the West Semitic milieu during the second millennium. The god El did not exist in the earliest Semitic  pantheons: those of Ebla and Akkad
#It is possible that Hutena and Hutellura, who belong to the kaluti of Hebat, have been modeled on the Syrian birth goddesses.1
#The Ugaritic pantheon has ktrt (Kotharāt) translated d Sa-sú-ra-tum in the Akkadian version (RS 20.24), and ḫ dn ḫ dlr (Hutena - Hutellura) in the Hurrian lists

# The Hittite myths mention often a group of underworld gods, called "ancient gods," whose names come in rhyming pairs such as Nara-Napsara, Minki-Ammunki, Muntara-Mutmuntara. They were the earlier generations of gods, but they were driven into the underworld by Teshub. The "ancient gods" are a sort of opposite of the upper gods, because they are "impure" and represent the disorder.
#In addition to personal gods, Hurrians had impersonal divinities such as earth and heaven or mountains and rivers, the mountains being considered as companions of the storm god or as independent deities.

#### Commented out deities are bcs either barely any sources or they belong much more to another religion like f.ex. Adamma would
