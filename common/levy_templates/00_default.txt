# Scriptable Levy template, used to determine levy composition for different cultures.
# 	Each entry is either a levy tier "basic", "advanced", "special" which means that any subunit 
# 	marked as such could be chose to fill that slot, or it can be specific subunit type such as "archers".
#
#	NOTE: All numbers are relative percentages, ex. 0.2 means that 20% of this template should be a certain tier or unit
#	2nd NOTE: Support units will be added automatically in code when a certain size of Levy is raised, replacing another unit
#	3rd NOTE: If a specific subunit cannot be constructed for some reason another one that can from that tier will replace it ( if possible )
#
#	TODO: Scriptable blocks ex. "if this cannot be constructed then use this instead" (?)
