# When levies are raised, a certain amount of output produced by governorship pops is subtracted. We don't know what is
# the formula, and it's subtracted by directly replacing absolute output values on territory level. The problem is that
# we need to know research points produced without levy impact, otherwise every war makes AI think it has low research
# efficiency, leading to constructing building to raise it, leading to too much research once levy impact is removed.
#
# To counter this we are caching research points on per-governorship basis in the scope of the capital, so when levies
# are raised, we temporarily use older values as a substitution.
