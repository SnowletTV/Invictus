### cf. triggers file
### Setup effect (in mission on_potential or on_start) creates the variables etc for you
### Change points value (currently only add = 1 supported; negative vlaues aren't supported; see the triggers how to add more with an if_else chain)
### All tooltips NEED to be manually created, for every trigger (number) ad effect (thus only +1 atm). The format HAS TO BE add_CULTURENAME_points_tt for the effect, and NUMBER_culture_points_CULTURENAME_tt for triggers. Smaller Than Numbers are expressed as UNDERSCORE_NUMBER (e.g. _3); cf. the triggers file and the Armenian loc file for references; easiest should be to copy paste and edit the variable names, culture names and colors.

### USAGE EXAMPLES; commented out

#culture_points_setup_effect = {
#	CULTURE = armenian # target culture
#	STARTING_VALUE = 0 # startig value the culture has; zero is baseline, so set to non-zero compared to zero as baseline; negative values aren't supported
#}

#change_culture_point_effect = {
#	CULTURE = armenian # target culture; only add = 1 is supported atm
#}

culture_points_setup_effect = {
	if = {
		limit = {
			NOT = {
				has_variable = $CULTURE$_culture_points
			}
		}
		set_variable = {
			name = $CULTURE$_culture_points
			value = $STARTING_VALUE$
		}
	}
}

change_culture_point_effect = {
	custom_tooltip = add_$CULTURE$_points_tt
	change_variable = {
		name = $CULTURE$_culture_points
		add = 1 # other values currently not supported due to tooltip dynamicity. if desired, can be done by copying this, changing add to desired value and creating the appropriate tooltip; this could also be expanded with a list of if_else (see triggers atm)
	}
