Now, with our victory won, Kleonymos has decided to use the opportunity to forge a new kingdom for us, with his comerades as his new Spartan nobility. But not all is well in our kingdom of Patauion.\n\nOutraged at being disenfranchised, the local Patavi look upon us with utter contempt, refusing all attempts to extract taxes and manpower. What's worse, with the mercenaries that helped bring us victory gone, they greatly outnumber us, far more so than the Helot slaves we were able to control back home. We may have created a new home for ourselves, but it's on extremely shakey ground. One wrong move, and it'll slip away from us.
