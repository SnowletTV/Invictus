 invasions_1_desc:0 "In the distant lands of the eastern steppes a tribal confederation known as the Xiongnu, under their leader Chanyu Modun, have subjugated the majority tribes beyond the Altai Mountains. Fear is growing that the Chanyu's gaze is set further south and west."

 invasions_2_title:0 "The Wusun Migration"
 invasions_2_desc:0 "The Wusun peoples, an Iranian-speaking steppe tribe with roots in Gansu, for centuries have been humiliated and defeated by their cousins, the Yuezhi. The Wusun were forced to become subjects of the great Chanyu Modun for protection, living within the lands of the Xiongnu and biding their time for revenge against the Yuezhi. Now that the Yuezhi have been shattered by the combined Xiongnu Confederacy and the Wusun, it is time to resettle our people in the fertile lands of the Ili Valley, the direction in which the remaining Yuezhi have fled. The Great Chanyu will aid in our conquest."

 invasions_5_title:0 "Yuezhi Invasion"
 invasions_5_desc:0 "The once powerful Yuezhi confederation, which dominated Southern Mongolia and Gansu for centuries, has been crushed by the upstart Chanyu Modun and his rising Xiongnu confederacy, with the aid of their old nemesis the Wusun, in 176 BC. The bulk of the Yuezhi fled west toward the Ili Valley and Sogdiana to escape the wrath of the mighty Chanyu, finding their chances better fighting against the Saka tribes, Sogdians and Ionians."

 invasions_6_title:0 "The Sakan Horde"
 invasions_6_desc:0 "The Yuezhi people have time and again forced the Saka people from their homes. First, the Ili Valley was taken by the Yuezhi following their migration from Gansu, forcing Saka peoples south and west. The Saka people were once again forced from their lands with the Yuezhi invasions of Sogdiana and then Bactria. Now, the Saka peoples must once again push south to survive, pushing into the Greek and Indian kingdoms of Gandhara and the Indus River."

 invasions_8_title:0 "Yuezhi Invasion of Bactria"
 invasions_8_desc:0 "Just as the Greater Yuezhi thought they had escaped the reach of the Xiongnu, the loyal Xiongnu vassal (and our former subject) the Wusun have been 'gifted' the lands of the Ili Valley by the Great Chanyu. The combined forces of the Wusun and Xiongnu Confederation are far too great to hope to fight off, and we must once again flee; this time south to the lands of the Greek-ruled Bactrians. Their lands are ripe for conquest now that they are sufficiently cut off from the rest of the Hellenic world. The Yuezhi shall subjugate the Bactrian cities, take their luxuries and, most importantly, stay far from the wrath of the Xiongnu. "
