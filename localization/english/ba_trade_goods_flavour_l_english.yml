Now recently there has been dissent in court as to how to approach the usage and exploitation of the trees. Some suggest an increase in felling trees to make a greater fleet as soon as possible, hoping to create an edge against rivals. Others support this general idea, but are more cautious and prioritise a long-term sustainability of the navy. Not to be forgotten are the nobles in support of more peaceful approaches with our neighbours; they seem to either fear a reaction by our rivals if we build a large fleet - or maybe they just would prefer to dominate the trade as is." #Exploit cedars for short-term gain. first option (not always available) kills a cedar forest, i.e. changes trade goods in a province
