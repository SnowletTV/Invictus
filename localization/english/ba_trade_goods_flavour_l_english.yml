trade_goods_flavour.7.desc: "Merchants travel from all across the Great Green to our island, hoping that they can take some of the cedar wood that grows on our shores - but we can hardly blame them. Cedar is a magnificent softwood, resistant to rot, and thus has excellent military applications, especially when it comes to building ships.

trade_goods_flavour.17.t: "Exploitation of the Cedar" 
trade_goods_flavour.17.desc: "The wood of the cedar trees is useful for many tasks, but chief among them is the making of ships, their planks being ideal. Now recently there has been dissent in court as to how to approach the usage and exploitation of the trees. Some suggest an increase in felling trees to make a greater fleet as soon as possible, hoping to create an edge against rivals. Others support this general idea, but are more cautious and prioritise a long-term sustainability of the navy. Not to be forgotten are the nobles in support of more peaceful approaches with our neighbours; they seem to either fear a reaction by our rivals if we build a large fleet - or maybe they just would prefer to dominate the trade as is." #Exploit cedars for short-term gain. first option (not always available) kills a cedar forest, i.e. changes trade goods in a province
