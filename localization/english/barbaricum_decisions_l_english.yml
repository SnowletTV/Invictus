 embellish_suebi_grave_fields_desc:0 "Many dead warriors were put to rest in the graves of #Y Laciburaium#!, their families laid next to them, and their spirits were released to the afterlife in elaborate cremation ceremonies. They all served us well, all in their own way. Their final resting places have been abandoned for decades and are now in a depblorable state. \nTheir released spirits may look down upon us benevolently from the afterlife - if we embellish and restore their graves. The dead deserve remembrance for the deeds they accomplished."
