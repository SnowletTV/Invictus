 flavor_germanics.1.desc:"Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."

Some of our men have brought up to imitate the Frisian terp settlements, which they erected several centuries ago.

However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a brown dog who has participated in the excarnation ritual of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName]'s body and shows similar behavior.

Luckily, no one fell down this time - a good omen. Last year the son of the shaman had to roll himself out on the floor, after he fell down. The past year brought us many storms and the harvest was bad. This was surely caused by the clumsy youth! \n\nThis year's sacrifice stands proud in the middle of the sacred ground, bound to the old oak behind him. His features are barely recognizable, for the sun's last rays of the day blind me, Mannus' will hiding him from my sight. Already the Shaman approaches the victim, pressing the knife's edge to his chest, provoking the first droplets of blood to drop on the oak sapling beneath him. Heis lifeblood will renew the forests and earth. To safeguard our communities and better our harvests, he is offered to Mannus. Now, the blade is piercing his heart, his last breath cursing us, yet igniting the fire of life. \n\nAlready, the birds have begun to sing and rejoice, filling the void left by the sacrifices' death."

Her first servant will follow his mistress to her domain in the ocean. There, the priest will encase the wagon again, after the slaves washed the wagon and ornated it with flowers and gold.

'King, chief or farmer, only a woman may visit the sacred island'.\n\nYou look out across the foggy water, only seeing the faint contour of the blessed island out beyond the waves. The nine priestesses of the Gallizenae dwelt on that island, and if the crones were to be believed they could turn themselves into beasts and command the winds. You came here because you needed their help.\n\n'Then you go, crone', you bellow at the old woman. 'I have business with the Gallizenae, but I will honor the gods and go no further'. The old woman smiled broadly, with not a tooth to show for it, and held out her open palm expectantly. Her dim eyes rolled back and forth in a crazed manner, looking at everything except you.\n\nReluctantly you place a pouch of coins, clinking softly, in her hand. 'What will my chief want the sacred priestesses for?' she asked in a mocking tone, her eyes suddenly fixed on you, unblinking."

A bent and kindly old woman stands beside you, pointing feebly towards a dark contour on the horizon.

'I seek passage, and I bring coin' you tell the old woman at which she lights up. 'Then we go now' she beamed and with unnatural energy she runs off.\n\nYou know well to follow, and soon find the old woman gesticulating to some fishermen to get off their boat. It is fitted with a large lantern at its prow and a set of oars, but the woman assures you she will take you to the island alone. 'We need no men, and besides they may not go' she mutters as the fishermen reluctantly leave.\n\nYou find yourself on the little boat, and the feeble woman appears not so feeble any more. She rows hard, and halfway out across the straight she asks 'What is lady's purpose with the priestesses?'. Her eyes are fixed on you, and they seem to belong to a young woman, not an old."

'The maiden priestess has counseled the gods' the crone said irreverently and sauntered off into the woods, leaving the maid with you alone. The young woman before you is astoundingly beautiful, and you feel a forbidden urge.\n\nShe comes close to you and speaks softly 'My chieftain, you sought Mullo's counsel?' You peer into her dark eyes and the fragrances of multiple herbs hang heavy in the air. Her breath grows heavier and the metal brooch presses against your chest.

'My lady suffers an ailment, priestess, and needs Mullo's blessing' the old woman says feebly, the energy suddenly at display during the journey having vanished.\n\n'I see' the priestess says hesitantly. 'Come with me'. You turn around to bid the old woman farewell, but she has vanished, and you decide to catch up with the priestess instead. The two of you arrive at a brook a little later at which the priestess stops.\n\n'Mullo is a kind god, but nothing is given freely' she almost whispers, and from within her cloak she produces a small pot which she hands you. 'Drink' is all she says as she takes five long steps away from you.\n\nYou drink deeply, and soon the world begins to spin violently.

This state of affairs has been satisfactory but a time of change is upon us, and although some are resisting the centralization efforts proposed by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], they will soon acquiesce. By uniting into a federated tribe, the potential benefits are manifold - we shall all see this in time."

Gesturing with a rabbit bone in your hand, you ask what they are carrying, and to your surprise, a handful of gold coins are offered to you. 'Ah yes, now I remember.' you say between bites. 'Yes, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received the first batch of coins that you have commanded be made. These will be the new standard used throughout our lands.' \n\n Taking a long swing from your mug, you take one of the coins and hold it up to the light, where the gold twinkles like fire, and you are immediately struck by the fearsome visage on the obverse."

Not only has a true city replaced the ramshackle hovels and lean-to sheds that once dotted the wooded landscape, but an even greater accomplishment has been achieved; a Great Temple, the likes of which have never been seen so far north, has been built in the heart of the new city of Baemia."

While you bristled at these criticisms, taking them to be thinly-veiled attacks against your leadership, you have secured victory against your foes yet again, silencing the wagging tongues of those that question your authority.

Our scouts pressed onward through vast swaths of land, stopping only at the foothills of the mountains, and come back with stories of pristine forests, grassy fields that would be perfect for livestock husbandry, and even large deposits of clay are present - we could start producing earthenware vessels. There will be costs associated with this colonization effort, of course, but you prepared for that in advance, didn't you?"

There are realms between the mountains that we have yet to settle, but we should double our efforts and secure them immediately - why, you might ask? There is good hunting to be found there, with plenty of wild animals to trap for their fur, and stone and woad are found in abundance in these regions."

 flavor_gaul.16.desc:0 "Now that we have settled the lands to our north, an old adage comes to mind; the more that you have, the more problems there seem to be. We are confident in our abilities to defend our homeland against anyone that might challenge us, yet, compared to our other possessions, our eastern flank is shamefully exposed. And there is no doubt that the tribes to our south, once they catch wind of our growth, might try to move closer to us, hoping to cut us off from expanding further. With this being said, we should consider pushing out to the east - some of the local rivers would make a good natural boundary. What do you think?"

Simply put, our people are clamoring for new lands to inhabit; our numbers swell daily, and the pasturage that we currently graze upon will not be enough to sustain our future growth. And yet we are surrounded by attractive lands, with good fields and plenty of natural resources for the taking, and if you but give the word, we shall send out the scouting parties. If they find territories that are satisfactory for our needs, you shall be the first to know."

 flavor_gaul.18.desc:0 "Chieftain, when I tell you this news, you will undoubtedly be as excited as we all are. It is true that we have spread out all across the lands you now command, but we have found even more territories that are worth taking. Just to the north of the Sudetes Mountains, the provinces are teeming with wildlife, and the stone quarries of Gothinia are practically begging to be emptied.
