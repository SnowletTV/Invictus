 flavor_germanics.1.t:0 "The Great Flood"
 flavor_germanics.1.desc:"Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."
 flavor_germanics.1.a:0 "Spend money."
 flavor_germanics.1.b:0 "Use the military as workforce."
 flavor_germanics.1.c:0 "They are on their own."
 flavor_germanics.1.tt:0 "Up to #Y 20%#! of the population of #Y [THIS.GetProvince.GetName]#! is killed by the flood."
 flavor_germanics.2.t:0 "Terp Settlement"
 flavor_germanics.2.desc:0 "The recent population boost has led to higher demand of habitable land. Some of our men have brought up to imitate the Frisian terp settlements, which they erected several centuries ago. Amsivaria's shore seems like a good place to pile up mud to create terps and build houses on top of these to protect them from the floods. We would need to send some of our men to help them, however."
 flavor_germanics.2.a:0 "Build such a settlement."
 flavor_germanics.2.b:0 "There are other more important matters."
 flavor_germanics.4.t:0 "Death of a Loved One"
 flavor_germanics.4.desc:0 "After the death of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName], people have tried to comfort me, but I never felt that they truly understood. Now I tend to avoid them and their idle chatter. However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a brown dog who has participated in the excarnation ritual of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName]'s body and shows similar behavior. Maybe the priest counseled me correctly and our loved ones truly live on in the dogs after an appropriate ceremony."
 flavor_germanics.4.a:0 "Pretty doggy, you understand me better than anyone."
 flavor_germanics.5.t:0 "Death of Your Dog"
 flavor_germanics.5.desc:0 "Your faithful and trusted dog has finally taken his last breath. Long has he served you since you first recognised your deceased loved one in his behavior, but now it's time to bury your old friend."
 flavor_germanics.5.a:0 "I will bury him quietly."
 flavor_germanics.6.t:0 "The Sacred Grove of Mannus"
 flavor_germanics.6.desc:0 "Once again it is time, the sacrifice to Mannus will happen tonight. As always we are fettered, showing our submission to our great God. Luckily, no one fell down this time - a good omen. Last year the son of the shaman had to roll himself out on the floor, after he fell down. The past year brought us many storms and the harvest was bad. This was surely caused by the clumsy youth! \n\nThis year's sacrifice stands proud in the middle of the sacred ground, bound to the old oak behind him. His features are barely recognisable, for the sun's last rays of the day blind me, Mannus' will hiding him from my sight. Already the Shaman approaches the victim, pressing the knife's edge to his chest, provoking the first droplets of blood to drop on the oak sapling beneath him. Heis lifeblood will renew the forests and earth. To safeguard our communities and better our harvests, he is offered to Mannus. Now, the blade is piercing his heart, his last breath cursing us, yet igniting the fire of life. \n\nAlready, the birds have begun to sing and rejoice, filling the void left by the sacrifices's death."
 flavor_germanics.6.a:0 "Mannus, grant us strength!"
 flavor_germanics.6.b:0 "Oppose the ritual."
 flavor_germanics.7.t:0 "Nerthus's Wagon into the Deeps"
 flavor_germanics.7.desc:0 "It is time for our priest to ride Nerthus's wagon again, the time for war is over. The sword shall be replaced by the plough, the fertile earth seeded with grains. When nerthus visits our homes, there will be more children, the fertility of the women is grander than before. They all are blessed by Her voyage over the land, until she tires of it. Her first servant will follow his mistress to her domain in the ocean. There, the priest will encase the wagon again, after the slaves washed the wagon and ornated it with flowers and gold. Thereafter, the slaves are devoured by the ocean, the last sacrifice to Nerthus, until she wakes once more and blesses the lands with Her presence."
 flavor_germanics.7.a:0 "Nerthus, bless us!"
 flavor_germanics.7.b:0 "Stop the Priest!"
 flavor_germanics.8.t:0 "Ariovistus"
 flavor_germanics.8.desc:0 "In our ranks, a man called by the Gauls Ariovistus, a Gaulish honorary title for a great military leader, has appeared recently. He is a true Suebian warrior who has fought and won many battles sometimes even together with Gauls. \n\nDuring these campaigns he has learnt the Gaulish language, a skill that together with his contacts to the Vangiones, Nemetes and Tribocci might aid us in forming an alliance with these tribes. \n\nAmong our people more and more call for his leadership, as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s achievements pale in comparison to Ariovistus's achievements."

 ariovistid_desc:0 "Ariovistus is a Gaulish honorary title for a great military leader. It was granted to a Suebian warrior who has fought and won many battles sometimes even together with Gauls. During these campaigns he has learnt the Gaulish language and garnered alliances with several Gaulish people. \n\nAlthough his original name faded, his feats are still remembered to this day. \n\n#G This trait can be passed on matrilineally or patrilineally.#!"
 flavor_germanics.9.t:0 "Ariovistus's Allies"
 flavor_germanics.9.desc:0 "Ariovistus's contacts to the Gauls living to our south have secured us 'alliances' with them, as they are obviously subordinate to us, the Suebi, in the form of tributaries."
 flavor_germanics.9.a:0 "They will make formidable 'allies'."
 flavor_germanics.10.t:0 "The Norican Marriage"
 flavor_germanics.10.desc:0 "Our plea for a political marriage with a Norican princess has been heard. They have presented [SCOPE.sChar('noric_princess').GetName], a fair and beautiful maid of noble origin."
 flavor_germanics.10.a:0 "Call for the priest."
 flavor_germanics.10.b:0 "There are better matches waiting."
 flavor_germanics.11.t:0 "The Lugian League"
 flavor_germanics.11.desc:0 "The Vandals are, notoriously, split into several different tribes. They don't like to renounce their tribal allegiance. If the Vandals are to thrive, we must unite them into a confederacy under the aegis of Lugus, the Celtic god of smiths, as the Celtic gods are apparently superior to our old beliefs.\n\nIf we managed to organize our scattered allies and the minor, independent factions, our hegemony would be indisputable."
 flavor_germanics.11.a:0 "Send out the invitations."
 flavor_germanics.12.t:0 "The Lugian League"
 flavor_germanics.12.desc:0 "Ambassadors from [SCOPE.sC('mission_country_lugia').GetName] have come to us with an offer. The Vandal tribes are weak while standing alone, and Central Europe has been the Celts' battlefield for too long. They claim that if the Vandals are to thrive, we must unite into a confederacy under the aegis of Lugus, the Celtic god of smiths, as the Celtic gods are apparently superior to our old beliefs. \n\nThe proposal is outrageous, but we might not have a choice, as a strong league under the protection of a strong leader might be our only chance of survival."
 flavor_germanics.12.a:0 "Join the league."
 flavor_germanics.12.b:0 "Defend our sovereignty!"

 flavor_germanics.13.desc:0 "Nehalennia, we thank you for a year of fertile soil, women and harvest. Many children were born, blessed with healthy limbs and spirit. The crops grew aplenty, for this we thank your priest, who brought you to us many seasons ago. We thank you for the protection of the living against evil spirits and the protection of the dead until they arrive in the afterlife. This perilous road into the kingdom of the dead, you saveguard. Your ship carries them all and brings the newborn to the wombs of the mothers. We thank you Nehelennia for hearing our pleas and we thank you for fulfilling them."

 flavor_germanics.15.t:0 "The Fall of the Aedui"
 flavor_germanics.15.desc:0 "The Aeduian oppidum lies in shambles, the Aedui are scattered, and our warriors looted everything they could find. In this turmoil, the Aedui sent a druid with an appeal for help, yet his mission was unsuccessful, as no one wants to aid the arrogant Aedui against our might."
 flavor_germanics.15.a:0 "The world shall burn!"
 flavor_germanics.16.t:0 "The Fall of the Ubii"
 flavor_germanics.16.desc:0 "Finally, the Ubian oppidum has fallen. The battle was quite fierce, as our warrios had to fight uphill and breach three circular ramparts. Afterwards, our Suebian warrios have plundered everything they could find. \n\nThe Ubii will no longer be able to aid the Gauls west of the Rhenus."
 flavor_germanics.16.a:0 "The world shall burn!"
 flavor_germanics.17.t:0 "Rex Germanorum"
 flavor_germanics.17.desc:0 "Only six steps. Then [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would be at the destination of his ambitious plans: sitting on the throne as anointed Rex Germanorum, how the Romans called him even before this day. \n\n [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would have preferably charged the last six steps. But out of deference to the majesty of the moment, he was treading step by step with dignity. \n\nWhen he stood before the unpretentious throne, he persevered shortly with his back towards the audience. Then he turned and again paused, while eyeing triumphantly and sternly the most significant man of his realm. \n\nUntil he sat down with rejoicings. A heady feeling flowed through him... omnipotence, infallibility and proudness. He was now [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] the first of his name, Rex Germanorum."

 startup_barbaricum.1.desc:0 "Around three centuries ago, our ancestors wrested the soil we live on from the sea. They piled up layer upon layer of mud until the so-called terps were created.\n\nOur people engage in animal husbandry and trade across the sea, of which the prospect has led to more and more imigrants coming to live here and literally building their own fortune.\n\nWhat the future holds is hard to say but perhaps we might eye the mysterious Albion island..."

 startup_barbaricum.2.t:0 "The Suebi"
 startup_barbaricum.2.desc:0 "The Suebi, also Irminones, developed from the local Bronze Age population around the river Albis, the modern Elbe. The coming of the Iron Age was accompanied by a transformation of society; henceforth all were equal in death, as everyone was buried in a locally manufactured urn after their remains had been cremated. \n\nYet, military prowess began to play an ever-increasing role, culminating in the Suebi becoming the paragon of Germanic culture. Young men of other tribes would style their hair in the Suebian way, known as the Suebian knot. \n\nTheir neighbors constantly watch for their raids in fear. But perhaps, a popular leader may break the tradition of equality in death ..."

 startup_barbaricum.3.t:0 "The Vandals"
 startup_barbaricum.3.desc:0 "First, the phenomenon of using face-urns started in in modern Pomernia and spread southwards into what would become continental Poland. These face-urns had lids in the form of hats, faces supposedly modelled after the buried and incised drawings. \n\nThe divergence between the northern people of the Baltic coast and the continental peoples has intensified over the course of time, and both would take other directions in the future. \n\nSo for example, the last century has seen an influx of Suebian migrants that live in separate settlements among our people and have kept their traditions and warrior traditions. What interactions arise between our culture and theirs is up to us."

 startup_barbaricum.4.desc:0 "Culture, beliefs and also people from the Nordic Bronze Age's original homeland, the Scandinavian Peninsula, came to the land that is Pomerania in modern times, where it merged into the local substrate. These were the roots of the Germanics living in this area and potentially also of later-recorded myths and legends. \n\nLater on, the phenomenon of using face-urns started in this area and spread southwards into what is nowadays continental Poland. These face-urns had lids in the form of hats, faces supposedly modelled after the buried and incised drawings. \n\nThe divergence between the southern Vandals and the people of the Baltic coast has intensified over the course of time and both would take other directions."

 startup_barbaricum.5.desc:0 "As part of the active trade routes stretching from Pritannia to Scandia, the Ingvaeonics have had easy access to commodities from either of the two and have benefited as middlemen, being able to speak both Celtic and Germanic. \n\n Their home is the eastern coast of the North Sea, characterised by mainly sandy beaches, river estuaries and the Wadden Sea. They are masters of this rough sea in their sturdy ships, and may soon turn their eyes toward new lands."

 startup_barbaricum.6.desc:0 "At the crossroads between the Celts and Germanic Suebi, between the rivers Rhenus (Rhine) and Visurigus (Weser), live the Istvaonics. Influenced by all of their neighbours to varying degrees, their culture and beliefs are an amalgam differing from tribe to tribe, as one tribe is more inclined to this side and the other tribe to another. \n\nYet, erecting hillforts for strong defense is a tradition shared by all Istvaonics to this day; the amount of social coordination and labour involved in this tradition cannot be understated. \n\nWhich path these tribes will take is anybody's guess. Will they unite or find themselves having been absorbed by foreign powers? Only time will tell."
