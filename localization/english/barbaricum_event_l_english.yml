 flavor_germanics.1.desc:0 "Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."

 flavor_germanics.6.desc:0 "Once again it is time, the sacrifice to Mannus will happen tonight. As always we are fettered, showing our submission to our great God. Luckily, no one fell down this time - a good omen. Last year the son of the shaman had to roll himself out on the floor, after he fell down. The past year brought us many storms and the harvest was bad. This was surely caused by the clumsy youth! \n\nThis year's sacrifice stands proud in the middle of the sacred ground, bound to the old oak behind him. His features are barely recognizable, for the sun's last rays of the day blind me, Mannus' will hiding him from my sight. Already the Shaman approaches the victim, pressing the knife's edge to his chest, provoking the first droplets of blood to drop on the oak sapling beneath him. Heis lifeblood will renew the forests and earth. To safeguard our communities and better our harvests, he is offered to Mannus. Now, the blade is piercing his heart, his last breath cursing us, yet igniting the fire of life. \n\nAlready, the birds have begun to sing and rejoice, filling the void left by the sacrifices death."

Her first servant will follow his mistress to her domain in the ocean. There, the priest will encase the wagon again, after the slaves washed the wagon and ornated it with flowers and gold.

'King, chief or farmer, only a woman may visit the sacred island'.\n\nYou look out across the foggy water, only seeing the faint contour of the blessed island out beyond the waves. The nine priestesses of the Gallizenae dwelt on that island, and if the crones were to be believed they could turn themselves into beasts and command the winds. You came here because you needed their help.\n\n'Then you go, crone', you bellow at the old woman. 'I have business with the Gallizenae, but I will honor the gods and go no further'. The old woman smiled broadly, with not a tooth to show for it, and held out her open palm expectantly. Her dim eyes rolled back and forth in a crazed manner, looking at everything except you.\n\nReluctantly you place a pouch of coins, clinking softly, in her hand. 'What will my chief want the sacred priestesses for?' she asked in a mocking tone, her eyes suddenly fixed on you, unblinking."

A bent and kindly old woman stands beside you, pointing feebly towards a dark contour on the horizon. 'There is where my lady must go, to find the oracle maids' she says weakly.\n\nThe island beyond is veiled in mists, and only women are allowed there. 'I seek passage, and I bring coin' you tell the old woman at which she lights up. 'Then we go now' she beamed and with unnatural energy she runs off.\n\nYou know well to follow, and soon find the old woman gesticulating to some fishermen to get off their boat. It is fitted with a large lantern at its prow and a set of oars, but the woman assures you she will take you to the island alone. 'We need no men, and besides they may not go' she mutters as the fishermen reluctantly leave.\n\nYou find yourself on the little boat, and the feeble woman appears not so feeble any more. She rows hard, and halfway out across the straight she asks 'What is lady's purpose with the priestesses?'. Her eyes are fixed on you, and they seem to belong to a young woman, not an old."

You make out an orange lantern fixed to the prow of a small boat, and once beached the crone scurries up to you with a young maid in tow.\n\nThe maid is clad in a fine linen cloak fixed with an ornate brooch above her breast. 'The maiden priestess has counseled the gods' the crone said irreverently and sauntered off into the woods, leaving the maid with you alone. The young woman before you is astoundingly beautiful, and you feel a forbidden urge.\n\nShe comes close to you and speaks softly 'My chieftain, you sought Mullo's counsel?' You peer into her dark eyes and the fragrances of multiple herbs hang heavy in the air. Her breath grows heavier and the metal brooch presses against your chest. 'Mullo's gift is best given privately' she murmurs and places her hand in yours.\n\n"

'My lady suffers an ailment, priestess, and needs Mullo's blessing' the old woman says feebly, the energy suddenly at display during the journey having vanished.\n\n'I see' the priestess says hesitantly. 'Come with me'. You turn around to bid the old woman farewell, but she has vanished, and you decide to catch up with the priestess instead. The two of you arrive at a brook a little later at which the priestess stops.\n\n'Mullo is a kind god, but nothing is given freely' she almost whispers, and from within her cloak she produces a small pot which she hands you. 'Drink' is all she says as she takes five long steps away from you.\n\nYou drink deeply, and soon the world begins to spin violently.

You try to speak, but she hushes you with a lone, white finger to your lips.\n\n'The gods know' she says, and forces you to your knees as the torches begin to dance around you in the darkness. The priestess begins to chant in a harrowing tone, once speaking clearly, next in tongues, as the women and men surrounding the two of you murmur and dance, fires whirling in the dark. The priestess is twitching now, then twist and turn as if some otherworldly force was over her, and her chants break up into screams of terror and reverence alike.\n\nSuddenly the fires come to a silent stop, and the maiden collapses before you, doused in sweat.

Our people are ambitious and hearty, unafraid of any challenges, and we soon had all of the freemen we needed - we are fortunate beyond measure, to be blessed as we are. These settlers are gathering near the foothills of the [GetProvince('(int32)3617').GetArea.GetName], awaiting word of where they shall be sent."

 flavor_gaul.45.desc:0 "We have exciting news to report from the Royal Library, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Acknowledging that our needs were far greater than what was locally available, we started to import papyrus, hoping to augment our own writing materials with this Egyptian wonder. The steady stream of papyrus has allowed our scribes to make copies of the various texts that we have come into possession of, and our knowledge has grown exponentially because of it - we shall see the results almost immediately, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."

 flavor_gaul.46.desc:0 "Firmly believing that the wise leader acknowledges their debts, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made it known that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will honor our ancestors with the proper religious ceremonies, including one of our most sacred and ancient practices - the wagon burial - when the time comes. Although obtaining a steady income is difficult for a small tribe, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has stated that no corners will be cut and every expense will be paid without question.\n\nWhile some lament the vast sums involved in such matters, the majority of our people praise [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s piety as an example for our younger generations."

 flavor_gaul.47.desc:0 "As the period of mourning for our previous leader begins, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been privately approached by the Wise Ones and the Elders, who insist that we honor our old ways by giving the deceased a proper [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] Wagon Burial. This is a great honor, reserved only for the most elite in our society, but whether or not we proceed is entirely up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nAlthough it is unpleasant to discuss financial matters when our entire nation is grieving, there are substantial costs associated with wagon burials and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to sign off on the purchases."

 flavor_gaul.48.desc:0 "There is a somber procession taking place a few hour's ride outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] as the final preparations are being made for one of our most ancient traditions; the wagon burial of a cultural elite.\n\nAll manner of grave goods are lowered into the ground - sumptuous dining dishes wrought in silver, torcs of gold and ceremonial fur capes, drinking horns and gem-encrusted banquet trays - as the requisite animals and slaves are sacrificed nearby. Everything has been done to exacting standards, and the omens show that the gods are very pleased by our attention to the finer details.\n\nThere is a respectful silence as the last of the earth falls over the wagon, and one by one, everyone turns towards [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who offers a few words."

 flavor_gaul.49.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a reputation for not allowing anything to get in the way of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] plans being completed; every military matter that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has encountered, for example, has been handled promptly and ruthlessly, with an efficiency that could be mistaken for callousness.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to those paying attention that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] would resort to political bribery in order to move the gears of state. Every bag of silver handed over, every golden torc, was delivered with an unspoken threat to seal the deal."

When the sun sets in a few hours and the sacrifices are complete, we shall have a new form of government.\n\nAlthough our people have never been governed by a true sovereign before, it has been acknowledged that the time is finally here.

 flavor_gaul.51.desc:0 "When all is said and done, there is much for our people to be proud of. Not only have we destroyed the inferior tribes that surrounded us, absorbing their strength and power into our own, but we have started to create a civilization that is truly worthy of being respected. We have also raised up a line of Kings to rule over us, and our engineers have tamed the wild woodlands, building cities and magnificent edifices that dazzle the eye with their cleverness.\n\nWhile the people have done much to deserve these honors themselves, many admit that we would not be as far along as we are without [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s detractors admit that we have been blessed with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] leadership."

 flavor_gaul.52.desc:0 "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has certainly serviced our people well, lately, there is a growing chorus demanding that we move our capital to [GetProvince('(int32)3690').GetName]. Not only does the city of Treveria have river access, which is vital for its economic success, but it is also located on the plains, which gives our people room to expand in the future. The forests near Caranusca are proving to be a hindrance to development, as everything costs more.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a decision to make."

Having gone through such difficulties to secure the territory, all can understand the need to personally verify our accomplishments.\n\nThe Belgae tribesmen seem humbled, for once - there are no challenging looks offered to our people as the royal procession moves through the streets. Their spirit of resistance seems to have been broken; news that our military advisors will be happy to hear.\n\nAs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s chariot turns down the road leading home, a fox darts across the highway, disappearing in the forest."
