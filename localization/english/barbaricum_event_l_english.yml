'King, chief or farmer, only a woman may visit the sacred island'.\n\nYou look out across the foggy water, only seeing the faint contour of the blessed island out beyond the waves. The nine priestesses of the Gallizenae dwelt on that island, and if the crones were to be believed they could turn themselves into beasts and command the winds. You came here because you needed their help.\n\n'Then you go, crone', you bellow at the old woman. 'I have business with the Gallizenae, but I will honor the gods and go no further'. The old woman smiled broadly, with not a tooth to show for it, and held out her open palm expectantly. Her dim eyes rolled back and forth in a crazed manner, looking at everything except you.\n\nReluctantly you place a pouch of coins, clinking softly, in her hand.

'I seek passage, and I bring coin' you tell the old woman at which she lights up. 'Then we go now' she beamed and with unnatural energy she runs off.\n\nYou know well to follow, and soon find the old woman gesticulating to some fishermen to get off their boat. It is fitted with a large lantern at its prow and a set of oars, but the woman assures you she will take you to the island alone. 'We need no men, and besides they may not go' she mutters as the fishermen reluctantly leave.\n\nYou find yourself on the little boat, and the feeble woman appears not so feeble any more. She rows hard, and halfway out across the straight she asks 'What is lady's purpose with the priestesses?'. Her eyes are fixed on you, and they seem to belong to a young woman, not an old."

'The maiden priestess has counseled the gods' the crone said irreverently and sauntered off into the woods, leaving the maid with you alone. The young woman before you is astoundingly beautiful, and you feel a forbidden urge.\n\nShe comes close to you and speaks softly 'My chieftain, you sought Mullo's counsel?' You peer into her dark eyes and the fragrances of multiple herbs hang heavy in the air. Her breath grows heavier and the metal brooch presses against your chest.

'My lady suffers an ailment, priestess, and needs Mullo's blessing' the old woman says feebly, the energy suddenly at display during the journey having vanished.\n\n'I see' the priestess says hesitantly. 'Come with me'. You turn around to bid the old woman farewell, but she has vanished, and you decide to catch up with the priestess instead. The two of you arrive at a brook a little later at which the priestess stops.\n\n'Mullo is a kind god, but nothing is given freely' she almost whispers, and from within her cloak she produces a small pot which she hands you. 'Drink' is all she says as she takes five long steps away from you.\n\nYou drink deeply, and soon the world begins to spin violently.

You try to speak, but she hushes you with a lone, white finger to your lips.\n\n'The gods know' she says, and forces you to your knees as the torches begin to dance around you in the darkness. The priestess begins to chant in a harrowing tone, once speaking clearly, next in tongues, as the women and men surrounding the two of you murmur and dance, fires whirling in the dark. The priestess is twitching now, then twist and turn as if some otherworldly force was over her, and her chants break up into screams of terror and reverence alike.\n\nSuddenly the fires come to a silent stop, and the maiden collapses before you, doused in sweat.

The other eight scatter into the dark woods as you approach, and the one left bids you to kneel before the stone.\n\nShe picks up a wooden bowl and raises it to the moon above and begins to chant.

'You seek the guidance of Toutatis?' she asks, before turning away from you towards the sea without awaiting a reply.\n\nShe holds her hand out towards you, and you grab it uncertainly. She drags you out into the cold water, and her trembling chant is all you could hear over the rush of the waves that envelopes you. You hold the priestess's hand tightly, fearing that the surge would steal her into the sea.\n\nThe cold waves are now submerging her golden head, yet she pushes on with you following.

When you come out upon the shore the moon still hangs low and the sun is yet to rise. 'Toutatis requires his proof' she says solemnly, and grabs your hand.\n\nWith you in tow she walks into the cold, black waves and begins to chant a godly hymn.

 flavor_gaul.117.desc:0 "The precious orange stone known as lyngourion to the Greek Massalians, once only trickling from eastern trade in miniscule amounts, has become more plentiful as the result of the endevous of our most ambitious merchants. Having sought to make the most of the potential profits the trade of this good can afford, our traders have journeyed to the Northwestern lands where the stone can be found, making deals with the various tribes that live along the coast of the Suebic sea. While still an expensive good, necklaces and other elaborate items containing amber have become ever more ubiquitous among those of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s who can afford such things, as our new direct trade routes permit a greater quantity of the stuff to arrive in our lands."

 flavor_gaul.118.t:0 "Expanded North-Western Trade"
 flavor_gaul.118.desc:0 "While the lands of the Northern Isles have been under [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetAdjective] control for some time now, it had become apparent the limit on the quantity of goods that we could extract from those lands. From metals, pottery, meats, wool and the like, the existing ports would be filled with goods, only for our foods to rot and precious items be lost to bandits, with only a trickle actually being sent to Aremorica.\n\nOur [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] however, started the construction of settlements and ports all along the Pritannian shore in a bid to remedy this trouble. Now a far greater magnitude of goods are able to arrive at our metropolis, comming from those North-Western Isles."
 flavor_gaul.118.a:0 "The significance of our holding of Pritannia grows immensely!"

 flavor_gaul.119.t:0 "Greater than Carthage"
 flavor_gaul.119.desc:0 "Vast have the ranges of our trade fleets become, and ever larger has our navy grown. While we once merely saw the traders of Carthage as amicable foreigners, the rise in our country's power compeled them to hostilities against us. And so the Carthaginians attempted to cut off our routes, sabotage our relations with other countries and perform every action of harm that one would do to diminish a potential rival. However all of this has come to nought.\n\nIt is clear now that our commercial and naval power has vastly overtaken that of the Empire of the Carthaginians, and we have risen as such that we are now perfectly equiped to bring our will and influence upon that Southern sea that Carthage calls her home waters."
 flavor_gaul.119.a:0 "Our influence shall be felt beyond the shores of Baetica!"
