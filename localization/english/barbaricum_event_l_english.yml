The nine priestesses of the Gallizenae dwelt on that island, and if the crones were to be believed they could turn themselves into beasts and command the winds. You came here because you needed their help.\n\n'Then you go, crone', you bellow at the old woman. 'I have business with the Gallizenae, but I will honor the gods and go no further'. The old woman smiled broadly, with not a tooth to show for it, and held out her open palm expectantly. Her dim eyes rolled back and forth in a crazed manner, looking at everything except you.\n\nReluctantly you place a pouch of coins, clinking softly, in her hand.

It is fitted with a large lantern at its prow and a set of oars, but the woman assures you she will take you to the island alone. 'We need no men, and besides they may not go' she mutters as the fishermen reluctantly leave.\n\nYou find yourself on the little boat, and the feeble woman appears not so feeble any more.

'The maiden priestess has counseled the gods' the crone said irreverently and sauntered off into the woods, leaving the maid with you alone. The young woman before you is astoundingly beautiful, and you feel a forbidden urge.\n\nShe comes close to you and speaks softly 'My chieftain, you sought Mullo's counsel?'
