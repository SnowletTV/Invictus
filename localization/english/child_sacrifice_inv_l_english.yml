 child_sacrifice_inv.1.t:0 "Sacrifice for the Gods"
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.desc:0 "Recently, #Y [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]#! has been befallen with misfortune. Whispers have arisen in court that you are incapable of ruling. Not everything is #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]#!'s fault, however. The recent wars have destabilized the realm. The people are unhappy and the army discouraged from recent defeats. \n#Y [SCOPE.sCharacter('murder_priest')GetName]#! has proposed a time-honored ritual to restore faith among the populace. By sacrificing a child to the Gods, we are sure to gain favor with them. They would surely bless us, if only we chose a worthy sacrifice..."
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.a:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('sacrifice_1')GetName] shall be sacrificed!"
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.b:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('sacrifice_2')GetName] shall be sacrificed!"
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.c:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('sacrifice_3')GetName] shall be sacrificed!"
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.d:0 "Three are better than one."
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.d.tt:0 "Your ruler is either deranged or exceptionally religious."
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.e:0 "We will find another way."
 child_sacrifice_inv.1.e.tt:0 "Your ruler either doesn't buy into the religious narrative or he doesn't have the heart to kill kids."
 child_sacrifice_inv.2.t:0 "An Auspicious Omen"
 child_sacrifice_inv.2.desc:0 "The Gods smile down on us. They deem our sacrifice worthy. They have sent an omen. Our bulls are healthier than ever before. The priests assure us that we have been blessed. \nOur troops have gained their spirit again, fighting fiercer than before. The slaves are rejoicing and the nobles relieved that the future is now secure. Popular support has increased and your governance is being accepted now."
 child_sacrifice_inv.2.a:0 "Praise the Gods."
 child_sacrifice_inv.3.t:0 "Hopeful Signs"
 child_sacrifice_inv.3.desc:0 "The priests tell us that the Gods are content with our sacrifice. They have spotted a pattern in the intestines of the bull butchered last night. It is showing clearly that the Gods approve of our offering, and for that they have granted us a minor boon. Baal will let it rain more in our lands. \nThe farmers are now more confident about the future and have started to till the fields again. The citizens and nobles have started to accept your rule once again."
 child_sacrifice_inv.3.a:0 "We thank the Gods."
 child_sacrifice_inv.4.t:0 "Ominous Signs"
 child_sacrifice_inv.4.desc:0 "It hasn't rained for a long time. Maybe it's a sign of the Gods? The priest interpret it as such. Your standing with the individuals of note has fallen further and more of our rural subjects have started to question your ability to rule... \nThe sacrifice mustn't have been to the taste of Baal, the lord of rain. We now pay the price of offering inferior tribute."
 child_sacrifice_inv.4.a:0 "It was a mistake."
 child_sacrifice_inv.5.t:0 "A Disastrous Omen"
 child_sacrifice_inv.5.desc:0 "Storms have ravaged our fleets and blockaded our ports for weeks now. The Gods are surely punishing us, for we offered them the most inferior of oblations, and the child wasn't fit for it. Additionally, our priests had not carried out the ceremonies well enough, for they were in haste. This must have angered the Gods, for we cannot trade or fish. Even worse, parts of our Cedar forests have burned down."
 child_sacrifice_inv.5.a:0 "We are doomed"
 child_sacrifice_inv.6.t:0 "Discouraged Populace"
 child_sacrifice_inv.6.desc:0 "Our subjects had anticipated the sacrifice that would sway the Gods, yet #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]#! has just decreed that no child would be sacrificed. They would in the future be bright minds our nation would need, be it as mothers or warriors. \nIt isn't unexpected that the decision would be met with disapproval. Now, protests have once again flared up across the country. We should prepare for the worst..."
 child_sacrifice_inv.6.a:0 "At least the children are safe"
