 form_liguria_desc:0 "The Ligurians have persisted in Cisalpine Gaul for millennia, living divided among small tribes and toiling in the fields. However, a new power to the south is rising which, if left unchecked, could threaten our very existence. In order to counteract this threat, we must band together into a pan-Ligurian federation capable of fighting those who would subjugate us."

 form_slavia:0 "Form Slavia"
 form_slavia_desc:0 "Us Slavs have lived along the boundaries of the known world for millennia, eking out a meager existence dwelling among the vast forests. Yet in spite of our similarities, we are scattered and divided, living as if we were separate peoples, fighting and warring amongst each other over petty despites and meaningless feuds. If we were to rise up and subdue the rest of our kin, we could proclaim a pan-Slavic federation stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Steppe, capable of subduing those foolish enough to challenge us."

 form_punt:0 "Form Punt"
 form_punt_desc:0 "From Adouli to Apocopa, Punt has been at the crossroads of commerce for generations, with ivory from Africa, frankincense from Arabia, and even spices from distant India passing through its ports.

 form_tibetan_empire:0 "Form Tibet"
 form_tibetan_empire_desc:0 "Tibet has long been a backwater, isolated on the mountain tops which protect us. However, our harsh and treacherous lands will not protect us forever, for sooner or later, we will be conquered by a force too great and terrible to overcome on our own; to survive we must end our time of isolation, and actively lay conquest to our neighbors. With the plateau firmly secured within the borders of our realm, we can proclaim a glorious Tibetan Empire capable of projecting power and influence from the top of the world!"

 form_arabia:0 "Form Arabia"
 form_arabia_desc:0 "For generations, Arabia has been a nexus of trade, providing frankincense and myrrh to the major civilizations of the world, but our potential for greatness has been squandered by the many fragmented tribes and kingdoms of the region, who wage war amongst themselves instead of working together.

 form_germania:0 "Form Germania"
 form_germania_desc:0 "The tribes of Germania are each individually strong and powerful, yet without a strong leader to lead them, we remain just that; separate tribes too busy being mired in infighting then to partake in the greater glory that awaits us. By subjugating and deposing of our weak and short-sighted rivals, we will be able to proclaim a Germanic Empire capable of waging titanic wars that will be spoken of in legend for a thousand years to come, and dominance of the continent shall be ours!"
