Ptolemaios married his daughter Eirene to Eunostos shortly after Eunostos's father died to ensure that the new king of a leading Cypriot kingdom would remain loyal. Nikokreon's domains were greatly expanded; he was appointed as the chief Ptolemaic officer on the island and named the strategos of Cyprus.\n\nThough Nikokreon was favored by Ptolemaios, his death in 309 BC led to a direct Ptolemaic administration of Cyprus and the abolishment of remaining independent Cypriot kingdoms.

During the campaign of Alexander the Great in 334 BC, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Arsites, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Granicus River, after which he committed suicide. Alexander appointed Calas as his successor. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, a member of the royal house of Lyncestis in Macedonia and one of Alexander's trusted bodyguards. Leonnatus entertained ambitions beyond his satrapy; he sought marriage with Cleopatra, Alexander’s sister, a move that could have strengthened his claim to power. Had he defeated the Athenians, Leonnatus may very well have attempted to seize the Macedonian throne for himself. His career was cut short during the Lamian War, where he led a force of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to relieve Antipater during the siege of Lamia. Leonnatus was killed in the battle, leaving his aspirations unfulfilled. Control of the satrapy then passed to Arrhidaeus, who held it until the Partition of Triparadisus (321 BC), after which Clitus the White was assigned as satrap. Clitus' rule was brief. He was defeated and killed in 317 BC by Arrhidaeus. His successor, Ardys, governed for an uncertain period before power shifted again. Phoenix of Tenedos, a loyal subordinate of Antigonus, governed the region for a time, followed by Antigonos' nephew Polemaios, another of Antigonus’ generals.
