After this, Demetrius invaded Kýpros and Eunostos of Soloi, the last Kýpriot king, fled to the Ptolemaic Kingdom for protection and married Ptolemaios's daughter Eirene. Now the Pasikratids languish in exile, waiting for the day when their kingdom will be restored to them, a fantasy yes; however, lasting control of the Copper Island might best be secured by reviving the old city-state of the Pasikratids - a kindness that will no doubt be generously rewarded."

At the time of its inception, the league was made up of twelve member groups: Aenianes, Boeotians, Dolopes, Dorians, Ionians, Locrians, Magnetians, Malians, Perrhoebians, Phocians, Pythians, and Thessalians. Organized out of the eponymous settlement of Delphi to support the rites and temple maintenance of Apollo and Demeter at Delphi, the Delphic Amphictyony doled out religious law and punishment, conducted warfare, and established rules of conflict and statehood. \n\nThe Third Sacred War (356 BC) kicked off after the Phocians seized Delphi and looted its treasury. Eventually, Phillip's Macedonians joined the war against the Phocians, defeated them, and were given their seats on the league council, serving as a prelude to his seizure of Greece through a combination of diplomacy and force."
