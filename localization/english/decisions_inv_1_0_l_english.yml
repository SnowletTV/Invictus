After this, Demetrius invaded Kýpros and Eunostos of Soloi, the last Kýpriot king, fled to the Ptolemaic Kingdom for protection and married Ptolemaios's daughter Eirene. \n\nNow that it has fallen out of Antigonid hands, it seems that many of the Kýpriot city states, are taking advantage of the lapse in Macedonian presence and are rapidly seizing parcels of newly garrisoned land in an attempt to reestablish their old kingdoms.

At the time of its inception, the league was made up of twelve member groups: Aenianes, Boeotians, Dolopes, Dorians, Ionians, Locrians, Magnetians, Malians, Perrhoebians, Phocians, Pythians, and Thessalians. Organized out of the eponymous settlement of Delphi to support the rites and temple maintenance of Apollo and Demeter at Delphi, the Delphic Amphictyony doled out religious law and punishment, conducted warfare, and established rules of conflict and statehood. \n\nThe Third Sacred War (356 BC) kicked off after the Phocians seized Delphi and looted its treasury. Eventually, Phillip's Macedonians joined the war against the Phocians, defeated them, and were given their seats on the league council, serving as a prelude to his seizure of Greece through a combination of diplomacy and force."
