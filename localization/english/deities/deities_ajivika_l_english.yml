 omen_makkhali_gosala:0 "Makkhali Gosala"
 omen_makkhali_gosala_desc:0 "The founder of Ajivika, Makkhali Gosala was born in a small village to a low caste family in a cowshed. He would go on to become an ascetic pupil of Mahavira three years after Mahavira's start to Asceticism. However, philosophical disputes between the two lead to Makkhali Gosala splitting from Mahavira's Jainist sect and founding a new branch of Ajivika. While Ajivika was around for a long time by that point, Makkhali Gosala was able to unite the sect and forge it into a dangerous rival to Buddhism and Jainism. This resulted in scrutiny from Jainist sects but also much more scrutiny from Buddhists, with Buddhists thinking of Makkhali as a 'stupid man' and Ajivika as 'the most dangerous of all the cults.'\n\nMakkhali Gosala claimed to be in a line of reincarnants who within them resides the soul of Udai Kundiyayaniya, in which it resided within him for 16 years as he resided in Halahala at Savatthi. He may have claimed this in order to separate himself from his past under Mahavira and the Jainist faiths."

 omen_kisa_sankicca:0 "Kisa Sankicca"
 omen_kisa_sankicca_desc:0 "Only known as one of the important figures of Ajivika, Kisa Sankicca is the second leader of Ajivika according to records. Nothing is known about him other than the implied esteem he must have had to be considered one of three great leaders of the faith. It's possible that he was a contemporary of Mikkhali and Nanda, and his name being second on the list may imply he was the second of the three to grow to prominence for the Ajivika. Considering it was Purana who named him as one of the great Ajivika leaders, Kisa was likely revered by Purana Kassapa, the leader proceeding Makkhali for the Ajivika."

 deity_nanda_vaccha:0 "$omen_nanda_vaccha$"
 omen_nanda_vaccha:0 "Nanda Vaccha"
 omen_nanda_vaccha_desc:0 "The first on the list of important leaders, proceeded by Kisa Sankicca and Makkhali Gosala, Nanda Vaccha may have been the first of the three Ajivika leaders at the time of Makkhali Gosala. He was often mentioned with Kisa and Makkhali, and listed as the first name, so it could be that he actually predates the two. Regardless, it's clear that he was held in high regards to the Ajivika. Considering it was Purana who named him as one of the great Ajivika leaders, Nanda was likely revered by Purana Kassapa, the leader proceeding Makkhali for the Ajivika."

 deity_niyati:0 "$omen_niyati$"
 omen_niyati:0 "Niyati"
 omen_niyati_desc:0 "Niyati refers to the concept of fate. It is this tenant of Ajivika which sets it apart from the other Shramanic faiths. Niyati is unchangeable, unmoveable, and humans cannot alter it. Niyati controls every action and all phenomena, leaving no room for human volition. It is the predetermined will of the universal spirit. Any action that has been, is being, or will be, are all going to happen. Humans cannot sin as it was predetermined to happen. A Buddhist will question, if this is the case, what prevents one from stealing? Ajivika responds, if it is to happen, it will happen, as too will the punishment and response, which too will happen. A Jainist may ask, why practice asceticism if everything that will happen, will happen, and unable to be changed? And Ajivika responds again, asceticism is enjoyed by those who are fated to enjoy it, among those are they the Ajivika."

 deity_paramanu:0 "$omen_paramanu$"
 omen_paramanu:0 "Paramanu"
 omen_paramanu_desc:0 "Paramanu is a term referring to the concept of the atom. Atomism was a concept absorbed into Ajivika as one of the basic beliefs. It fit well with the belief of Niyati, and was possibly the first Indian religion to conceptualize an Atomic theory. For this reason, Ajivika, more than Jainism or Buddhism, leaned towards atheism, as Atomism lends itself well to materialistic atheism in which the modern understanding of atheism stems from. Regardless, the paramanu is the smallest substance from which everything is built and it is indivisible, for it is the smallest unit there is to exist."

He who lived for 21 years under the soul of Udai at the Mandiya Caitya, outside Uddandapura."

 deity_mandiya:0 "$omen_mandiya$"
 omen_mandiya:0 "Mandiya"
 omen_mandiya_desc:0 "The third shadowy figure of whom Makkhali claimed to be reincarnated from. He is theorized to be the third of the seven great teachers of Ajivika who Makkhali Gosala related himself to in order to separate himself from his Jainist origins.

Bharaddai lived with the soul of Udai for 18 years at the Pattakalagaya Caitya outside Alabhiya."

 omen_ajjuna:0 "Ajjuna Goyamaputta"
 omen_ajjuna_desc:0 "The sixth figure whom Makkhali Gosala claimed to be reincarnated from, Ajjuna Goyamaputta was the most likely to have actually existed. It is likely that before Makkhali, Ajjuna was the main leader of the Ajivika and thus being reincarnated from him would give Makkhali Gosala a lot of legitimacy in his eventual place as the greatest of all Ajivika leaders. Ajjuna was said to have lived 17 years with the soul of Udai at Kondiyanya Caitya outside Vesali."

 deity_udai:0 "$omen_udai$"
 omen_udai:0 "Udai Kundiyayaniya"
 omen_udai_desc:0 "The mysterious Udai Kundiyayaniya may have been the semi-mythical original founder of Ajivika. It may be that he lived before Ajivika was a full concept, but from him descend the Ajivika sect. Over time, Udai's full name was remembered and an idea formed that within him, his soul became the first migratory soul. Udai's soul was said to reside within other bodies, creating a new Ajivika teacher each time. In order, the soul of Udai rested in Enejjaga for 22 years, Mallarama for 21, Mandiya for 20, Roha for 19, Bharaddai for 18, Ajjuna Goyamaputta for 17, and Gosala Mankhaliputta (Makkhali Gosala) for 16 years."

 deity_purana:0 "$omen_purana$"
 omen_purana:0 "Purana Kassapa"
 omen_purana_desc:0 "Purana Kassapa was the leader of the Ajivika sect after Makkhali Gosala. He was considered a great threat to Buddhism and likely contributed much hate for the Ajivika from the Buddhists. Purana Kassapa also was the one to claim the three greatest of the Ajivika leaders were Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankiccha, and Makkhali Gosala. It is likely that this is because all three of those men must have been influential for the Ajivika sect and revolutionized it, especially Makkhali Gosala.\n\nPurana Kassapa was the cheif monk at the monastry of Ajivika monks at a place called Kukkutangara. He gained the epithet among his followers of 'the Lord of Puranan without comparison in intellegence.' Another epithet he gained was simply 'Puranan the Elder.' Purana Kassapa was of importance most to the Tamil Ajivikas, who held him as the greatest of the Ajivika teachers apart from only Makkhali Gosala himself.\n\nA story of the origin of Purana is filled with more legend than that of Makkhali. Purana was said to have been born a slave, who was treated well, however in spite of this, he ran away from his masters. In his run, thieves had stolen his clothes, and he had neither the will nor sense to cover himself up upon enterring a village. The villagers assumed he must have been a holy man, to have dressed with no clothes and in his pure form, called dharma-sata-pratticchana. Eventually, he embraced this nudity and refused clothes when offered and he would gain a following of 500 Ajivikas."

 deity_pakudha:0 "$omen_pakudha$"
 omen_pakudha:0 "Pakudha Kaccayana"
 omen_pakudha_desc:0 "Pakudha Kaccayana was possibly the next Ajivika leader after Purana Kassapa. Pakudha, unlike his two predecessors, had some different ideas to bring forth to Ajivika philosophy. He was best known to create the doctrine of the seven eternal and immutable elements: earth, water, fire, air, life, joy, and sorrow. He was also possibly the first of any Indian philosopher to present an atomic theory. While Atomism became part of Ajivika, at the time, he was not held in as high esteems as Purana and Makkhali were, and was said to have claimed NOT to have reached pure enlightenment, however his Atomist beliefs would go on to live past the death of Ajivika as a faith."
