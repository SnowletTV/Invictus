 omen_meis:0 "Meis"
 omen_meis_desc:0 "Meis, a form of the lunar god 'Men,' found at Lydia in Anatolia, likely plays a similar role in Caucasian mythos. It is likely this name is also the same as the niche lunar god Mangha or Mah. Unfortunately, we don't know much about Meis, so most of our assumptions are based around the Anatolian god Men who himself was influenced by the Zoroastrian and Mithraic god Mah. This may be why Men is associated with presiding over the lunar months, as the word in Avestan for moon and month is one and the same. He is also depicted with the horns of a crescent emerging from behind his shoulders."

Some elements of the Aguna ritual parallel the cult of the Phrygian-Greco-Roman deity Dionysus (Bacchus).\n\nDuring the harvest in Klarjeti, they held feasts in the vineyard where naked young men decorated with akido danced Ferkhuli, a native dance still practiced today.

A written historical source connects the name of Zaden with the name of Zaden Castle near Mtskheta. - "Aman Farnajo, the king, increased the construction of all the castles and cities, and he built the castle Zaden and created an idol named Zaden, and ruled Zaden.\n\nThe existence of the belief in Mithra in pagan Iberia and Colchis may be connected to Mithra. Some scholars state that Zaden was a Mithra; "Zaden is undoubtedly the Avesta Yazata or the Persian Yazdan, which means a good genius, especially Mithras, and then a good deity." In Mateane, this cult of Zaden-Mithra was second to the cult of Armazi."

On this "Badageon" he writes the following - "Whoever presses the grapes, they will say the name of Dionysus and make fun of him. This is a devilish thing, and it is a disgrace to Christians."

He would go on many adventures, however, would eventually displease a god by teaching humans how to use a special kind of metal.\n\nHis punishment had three steps. First being bound to a post deep within the earth. Then being burried by a mountain in chains. Finally, once a year, a passage to him would be openned up as humans try in vain to save him."
