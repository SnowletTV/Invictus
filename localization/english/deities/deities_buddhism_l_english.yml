Conventional values were all indifferent, and produced no more pleasure than pain. Most interestingly, he also said that both death and life were desireable. These ideas, as well as his time period, lead many to believe he was influenced by Indian Philosophies. A familiar idea appears in his infamous book, 'Death by Starvation,' which had apparently convinced so many people in Alexandria that Death is indeed more desirable than Life, that he would be banned from teaching in the great city by Ptolemy II Philadelphus."
