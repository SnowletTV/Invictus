 omen_inshushinak:0 "Inshushinak"
 omen_inshushinak_desc:0 "Inshushinak is the god of the Elamite city of Susa. He is sometimes called the greatest of all gods in Elamite mythology. He is seen as a powerful god of the underworld, and sometimes within the entourage of the powerful Mesopotamian goddess, Ereshkigal.\n\nIn Achaemenid Persia, Inshushinak lost much of his prominence outside of Susa itself. While he was once the greatest of the gods, other gods like Humban gained more importance in the post Neo-Elamite period. This stated, there are disagreements on if he was any less important to the Elamites themselves, or if the Indo-Iranian people simply neglected and disaproved of his veneration."

 deity_napirisha:0 "$omen_napirisha$"
 omen_napirisha:0 "Napirisha"
 omen_napirisha_desc:0 "Napirisha is the great god of the Kingdom of Anshan from the ancient times of the 3rd millenium BCE. Napirisha often takes the form of a primordial snake that represents the original waters of the world. For this reason, the Mesopotamians often compared him to their god, Enki, of the freshwaters. Napirisha and his consort, Kiririsha, were venerated in Susa with their titular god of Inshushinak."

 deity_ishnikarab:0 "$omen_ishnikarab$"
 omen_ishnikarab:0 "Ishmekaraba"
 omen_ishnikarab_desc:0 "Ishmekaraba started as an Akkadian deity known as Ishnikarab, however they were also of great importance to the Elamites. Ishmekaraba was a deity of justice and oaths. In Elamite mythology, although it is debated, many believe that Ishmekaraba was the spouse to the god of Susa, Ishushinak. She would later remain relevant and possibly contribute, along with her husband and a god named Lagamal, to the Zoroastrian belief of a triad of deities who pass judgment on souls."

 deity_lagamal:0 "$omen_lagamal$"
 omen_lagamal:0 "Lagamal"
 omen_lagamal_desc:0 "Lagamal started as an Akkadian deity, however they became an integral part to the Elamite pantheon after being introduced in Susa. Lagamal was a god of the underworld who judged the souls of the dead. He would be included amongst a group of three gods; himself, Inshushinak, and Ishnikarab; who possibly influenced the Zoroastrian belief of a triad of deities who pass judgement upon souls."

 deity_manzat:0 "$omen_manzat$"
 omen_manzat:0 "Manzat"
 omen_manzat_desc:0 "The goddess of the rainbow, Manzat, was primarily worshipped in the Elamite lowlands, as well as in both Sumeria and Akkad, though it is not known if she originates from Mesopotamia or Elam. Manzat was especially venerated in an area near Susa known as Hubshen. The goddess was associated with prosperity, especially of cities. She is sometimes called 'Great Lady' in the Elamite language. She became incredibly rare in attestations after the first millenium BCE, showing she was likely less important after that era."

 deity_tepti:0 "$omen_tepti$"
 omen_tepti:0 "Tepti"
 omen_tepti_desc:0 "Little is known about the mysterious deity referred to as Tepti. They appear in texts from the Neo-Elamite period, as well as in the names of some Elamite kings. In an inscription, it describes Tepti, Napirisha, and Kiririsha as deities who have always protected the waters and the earth. While Kiririsha is commonly attributed to protecting the earth, and Napirisha is well attested to be a god of water, Tepti's role in the triad is not known.."

 deity_tirutur:0 "$omen_tirutur$"
 omen_tirutur:0 "Tirutur"
 omen_tirutur_desc:0 "Tirutur is a mysterious god of which not much is written. He is mentioned in Neo-Elamite sources. Tirutur, along with Inshushinak, Tepti, and Humban, were associated with great divine and kingly powers, as well as a concept called 'Ktin,' which is best described as a divine protection for the people or kings of a land. During Achaemenid rule, Tirutur was conflated with Humban by the Persians."

 deity_shihhash:0 "$omen_shihhash$"
 omen_shihhash:0 "Shihhash"
 omen_shihhash_desc:0 "Shihhash is the Elamite version of the Canaanite god Adad. While it is not known if these are three seperate gods, or all the same god, the Elamites had three epithets for Shihhash which are Shihhash, Shennukushu, and Kunzibami. As a version of Adad, Shihhash in Elamite religion is likely much more similar to the Mesopotamian versions, as even the name is likely from Mesopotamian origin."

 deity_simut:0 "$omen_simut$"
 omen_simut:0 "Simut"
 omen_simut_desc:0 "Simut, also called Shimut, is known as the 'Herald of the Gods' in Elamite mythology. Shimut was associated with the concept of 'Ktin,' similar to many prominent gods in Elamite religion. Simut would find himself often compared or syncretized with the Mesopotamian god Nergal, however recent research disputes the idea of Simut being an underworld god to the Elamites. It's possible he played some other role that was identified with Nergal."

 deity_pinigir:0 "$omen_pinikir$"
 omen_pinigir:0 "Pinigir"
 omen_pinigir_desc:0 "Also called Pinikir, Pinigir is a powerful goddess of Elamite origin, who was also widespread in Hurrian religion. She was associated with themes similar to that of Ishtar. She was a goddess of love and sex, but like Ishtar, she was also associated with war and stars, especially in her Hurrian version. Pinigir was worshipped in Elam until at least 500 BCE when the Neo-Assyrians burned her temple in Susa to the ground. It is more than likely she remained a relevant deity afterwards considering her prominence across Middle-Eastern pantheons."

 deity_hutran:0 "$omen_hutran$"
 omen_hutran:0 "Hutran"
 omen_hutran_desc:0 "Hutran is a god of divinity and kingship, much like Humban and Inshushinak. In fact, Hutran formed a godly triad within Elamite mythos. This triad often compared to the godly triad Hormazd-Mithra-Anahita in Indo-Iranic pantheons. Hutran was the only known son of the mother of gods, Kiririsha, and possibly the son of Napirisha if they were indeed a divine couple."

 deity_kirmashir:0 "$omen_kirmashir$"
 omen_kirmashir:0 "Kirmashir"
 omen_kirmashir_desc:0 "Kirmashir is one of the give gods from Aswan, just north of Susa. Along with Kirmashir was Humban, Pinigir, Hutran, and Nahunte. Not much is know about Kirmashir other than their origin from Aswan. Many of the gods of Aswan became relevant even till the Achaemenid period and beyong, however Kirmashir seems to have had much less relevancy. Despite this, Kirmashir was the namesake for the king Kuk-Kirmash from the Sukkalmah Dynasty during the latter part of the Old-Elamite period in 1900-1500 BCE."

 deity_narundi:0 "$omen_narundi$"
 omen_narundi:0 "Narundi"
 omen_narundi_desc:0 "A goddess of Susa, Narundi is actually the oldest known deity of the Elamite pantheon, first appearing in the records at 2260 BCE. Attestations of her after 1800 BCE cease, probably due to syncretism with other deities in the decentralized religion of the Elamites. She made an impression on the Mesopotamians who compared her to Ishtar. To the Mesopotamians, she was said to be one of the 'Divine Seven of Elam,' which was a group of seven war gods. It's unclear if the Elamites shared this same view on her mythology, though it's likely there was some elements of consistency between the two versions of the goddess."

 deity_nahiti:0 "$omen_nahiti$"
 omen_nahiti:0 "Nahhunte"
 omen_nahiti_desc:0 "Nahhunte, known in Old Elamite as Nahiti, was the lord of the sun in Elamite religion. He is known to be a keeper of oathes and justice. His statues were put up so that the leaders of the city or state would stay truthful and just in their rule. In Mespotamia, he was often paired with the moon god Sin. He was also said to be one of the 'Divine Seven of Elam,' especially mentioned with the goddess Narundi, another one of the seven. Interestingly, despite Nahhunte never being syncretised with Shamash nor Utu, in writing, Nahhunte is written the same way as Utu."

 deity_humban:0 "$omen_humban$"
 omen_humban:0 "Humban"
 omen_humban_desc:0 "The mightiest of the Elamite deities, bestower of Ktin, ruler of the heavens and skies, greatest of the gods, worshipped from the Tigris and Euphrates, from Susa to Anshan, and from the tips of the Zagros to the great cities of the Persians, this is Humban. In earlier times, Humban was the greatest god in eastern Elam, while Inshushinak reigned supreme in the west. By the time of the Achaemenids, however, Humban's popularity grew immensely. Humban, in fact, is sometimes argued to be more a god of the Persians than of the Elamites from this period, which speaks volumes of how revered he was. In the Persepolis fortification archive, Humban is mentioned a staggering 26 times, more than any other god. Even Ahura Mazda is mentioned but 10 times in the same document. In Mesopotamia, he is mentioned the third most of any god during the Kassite period. In the times of Neo-Assyria, Humban was often compared to Enlil in his significance and greatness. Truly, no god is better associated with the Elamites of the post Neo-Elamite period than the great Humban."

 deity_hishmitik:0 "$omen_hishmitik$"
 omen_hishmitik:0 "Hishmitik"
 omen_hishmitik_desc:0 "Hishmitik is a deity from Anshan, in the east of Elam. Hishmitak is known to have a shared temple in Chogha Zanbil with the god Ruhurater. This has been taken as evidence for Hismitak being the spouse of Ruhurater, however this is not universally agreed upon. Hismitak does not have much more written about her other than this, but, if she is indeed the spouse of Ruhurater, she may fill a similar or supporting role to Ruhurater."

 deity_ruhurater:0 "$omen_ruhurater$"
 omen_ruhurater:0 "Ruhurater"
 omen_ruhurater_desc:0 "A creator god of Anshan, Ruhurater is one of few gods that can bestow ktin to people. Although having associations with Anshan, possibly reaching his highest prominence there with his potential spouse Hishmitik, however the god was originally identified with the ancient city of Huhnur. Ruhurater is often seen as similar to Ishushinak, comparing him as the Ishushinak of Anshan."

 deity_kiririsha:0 "$omen_kiririsha$"
 omen_kiririsha:0 "Kiririsha"
 omen_kiririsha_desc:0 "The mother of gods, Kiririsha was one of the very most important gods of the Elamite pantheon. Herself, along with Tepti and Napirisha, were gods who let the world thrive, specifically, water and earth. As Napirisha is well-attested to be a deity of water, and Kiririsha is possibly the goddess of the earth. Napirisha and Kiririsha are actually a divine couple, their union bringing forth yet another god called as Hutran. She also is the tutelary goddess of Liyan, even having an epithet as 'zana Liyan lahakara,' which means 'lady of death at Liyan.' Her earliest attestation is from the 19th century BCE and survived as a worshipped deity past Achaemenid rule."

 omen_silir_qatru:0 "Silir Qatru"
 omen_silir_qatru_desc:0 "Silir Qatru, also known as Silir Katru, is known as a protector god of Elam itself. We know very little about this deity, only that he was invoked in Elam for protection, likely from invaders, raiders, or perhaps even smaller, domestic problems like crime or robberies."

 omen_upurkupak:0 "Upur-Kubak"
 omen_upurkupak_desc:0 "Upur-Kubak, also called Uper-Kupak or even Upurkubak, is a goddess of light. She is only known from one invocation in which she is called 'the lady who dispenses the light' by the Elamite king Huteltush-Inshushinak, who lived in the 11th century BCE."

 deity_napir:0 "$omen_napir$"
 omen_napir:0 "Napir"
 omen_napir_desc:0 "Napir, also called as Nap, is the god of the moon in the Elamite pantheon. He does not appear to be particularly popylar of a god, however, considering the writing of his name in linear Elamite, this would imply he was worshippedd up until at the least the 6th century BCE and during Persian rule."

 deity_ishmekarab:0 "$omen_ishmekarab$"
 omen_ishmekarab:0 "Ishmekarab"
 omen_ishmekarab_desc:0 "The attendent of the great Inshushinak and the protector of oaths, the Akadian-Mesopotamian origin god Ishmekarab became associated with Elam in the Neo-Babylonian era. Ishmekarab was worshipped until at least the Neo-Elamite period and possibly further. In a single reference he is mentioned as the god of Susa, however, it is likely that this was either a mistranslation or mistake for Inshushinak, or simply meaning to credit Ishmekarab as an attendant of Inshushinak."

 deity_shala:0 "$omen_shala$"
 omen_shala:0 "Shala"
 omen_shala_desc:0 "Shala, the wife of Adad, was introduced to Elam at the same time as the cult of her husband was introduced to the area. It should be noted that both her and her husband were likely the Mesopotamian versions, and not the more familiar Canaanite versions. She was a goddess of weather, like her husband, and was associated with the Elamite deity, Shihhash. Shala was likely worshipped in Anshan as well as the Elamite lowlands near Susa."

 deity_jabru:0 "$omen_jabru$"
 omen_jabru:0 "Jabru"
 omen_jabru_desc:0 "The god Jabru is an interesting case. He is clearly stated in Mesopotamian sources as a god of Elam, however, he is found no where in Elamite sources. There are several theories as to what this means. One theory is that Jabru is the father of Humban, the king of gods, by comparing Jabru with Anu. Like Anu, Jabru wouldn't have been worshipped as much as other gods despite being the father of the king of gods, if this theory is true. Another theory, asserts that Jabru might be a taboo name for for Tepti, however this theory is heavily disputed and claims several other gods who we consider to be seperate are just taboo names for different Elamite gods."

 deity_mashti:0 "$omen_mashti$"
 omen_mashti:0 "Mashti"
 omen_mashti_desc:0 "Mashti is an Elamite mother goddess. Not much else is known about her. She may come from Indo-Iranic syncretism with Elamite religion, introducing a form of Anahita. Another possibility is that the Elamite deity Mashti is related to the Dravidian deity Mastamma, however this is highly speculative. It too could be possible that Mashti is a corrupted for of the Babylonian solar god Ninib"
