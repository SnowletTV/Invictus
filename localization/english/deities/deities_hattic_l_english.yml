 omen_taru:0 "Taru"
 omen_taru_desc:0 "Taru, who was the original god to the Hittite god Tarhunna or Tarhunz, is a weather and storm god, often depicted as or associated with bulls. He was believed to have controlled lightning, thunder, and the growth of people and plants. Taru seems to have left quite an impression on the conquering Hittites, and served as an inspiration for gods of the cities of Nerik, Zippalanda, and even the head god of the Palaics: Ziparwa.\n\nTaru was paired with perhaps the most revered deity in all of the Hattic pantheon; Wurunshemu or Arinna. Together, the divine couple bore three children-Telipinu, Inara, and Mezulla-as well as a further lineage involving the goddess Zintuhi."

 deity_talipinu:0 "$omen_talipinu$"
 omen_talipinu:0 "Talipinu"
 omen_talipinu_desc:0 "The so called 'Exalted Son,' Talipinu was perhaps a storm god related to farming or fertility. Unlike his father, Taru, Talipinu seems to have had a more passive role. The Hittites expanded on this role greatly, with their version, 'Telipinu,'came a rather famous myth known as the Telipinu Myth.\n\nMist seized the windows. Smoke seized the house. On the hearth the logs were stifled. On the altars the gods were stifled. In the fold the sheep were stifled. In the corral the cows were stifled. The sheep refused her lamb. The cow refused her calf. Telipinu went off and took away grain, the fertility of the herds, growth, plenty, and satiety into the wilderness, to the meadow and the moor... Humans and gods perish from hunger."

 deity_estan:0 "$omen_estan$"
 omen_estan:0 "Estan Wurunshemu"
 omen_estan_desc:0 "Far better known as Arinna, or even as her epithet 'Wurunshemu' (Mother of the Land), Estan is perhaps the single most important Hattic deity. Her consort is the powerful storm god, Taru, who would serve as inspiration for many Hittite deities, and would even serve as the Old Hittite Kingdom's chief goddess. Her cult center was the city of Arinna, where she gained her more popular name of Arinna (however this epithet was adopted during the Middle Hittite Kingdom). Later, during the New Hittite Kingdom, she would be syncretized with the Hurrio-Hittite goddess Hepat.\n\nAlong with her prominence in her namesake city of Arinna, the sun goddess was associated with the city of Hattusha, where she was depicted as a sundisc. She was usually offered a bull as sacrifice (perhaps a reference to her consort of Taru) along with three sheep. She was also associated deeply with deer, with the Queen Puduhepa promising to Estan (Ishtanu in Hittite) that she would give the goddess many deer."

 deity_hatepinu:0 "$omen_hatepinu$"
 omen_hatepinu:0 "Hatepinu"
 omen_hatepinu_desc:0 "The daughter of the sea, Hatepinu's name literally means just that, 'Sea Daughter.' She is the consort to the son of Taru and Esthan, Talipinu, and they were both generally associated with agriculture. She became important in both the Hittite belief system, and seemed to hold quite a prominent place in the pantheon of the Kaska people."

 deity_katahzipuri:0 "$omen_katahzipuri$"
 omen_katahzipuri:0 "Katahzipuri"
 omen_katahzipuri_desc:0 "Better known by her Hittie form, Kamrusepa, Katahzipuri was the Hattic goddess of medicines and magics. She would play a pivotal role in the Talipinu Myth, acting as a pacifier to the angry 'missing' god of vegetation. She had many other roles as well, including that of a divine midwife as well as a household deity of the hearth and home. Interestingly, she was considered a resident of heaven, being depicted and called as a 'spirit of smoke' by the Hittites and Luwians. She also seemed to have a special connection to the city of Kanesh, strengthened by the later Hittite rituals of the area."

 deity_triple:0 "$omen_triple$"
 omen_triple:0 "Estan-Tappinu-Zintuhi"
 omen_triple_desc:0 "The three generations of goddesses; Estan the mother, Tappinu the daughter, and Zintuhi the granddaughter; were all three worshipped as one triple deity. This particularly exemplifies the importance of Estan (Arinna/Arinniti) in the holy city of Arinna. Tappinu, who is also called Mezulla by the Hittites, was called upon as an intermediatary for her mother as well during military campaigns. Unfortunately, we know not much about 'the granddaughter,' Zintuhi, and she appears to not have had a special function. She is known to have a peculiar epithet of 'Clothespin on her breast,' however the meaning of this is lost to time."

 deity_inaras:0 "$omen_inaras$"
 omen_inaras:0 "Inaras"
 omen_inaras_desc:0 "Inaras, or Inara, is a pivotal goddess in the Hattian spring festival of Puruli. The festival is dedicated the the goddess who we know only by the Hittite name Hannahanna, and seems to be a contemporary festival to the Akitu festival of Mesopotamian beliefs. Inaras' role is to give the storm-god (Tarhunna in Hittite, but likely Taru in original Hattic beliefs) help in the form of a trap. Inara uses the ruse of a feast to lure in and defeat the snake-dragon, Illuyanka (Hittite name, but originates in Hattic mythos). As a part of her plan, she seduces the mortal known as Hupasiyas of Zigaratta in order to enlist his help when the time comes. When the seprant-dragon is sufficiently drunk, Hupasiyas ties a rope around Illuyanka, allowing Inaras' father, presumably Taru, to destroy the evil being.\n\nAdditionally, there is an epilogue of sorts for both Inaras and Hupasiyas. First, Inaras builds a house for her mortal lover, high on a cliff. Her one instruction was for Hupasiyas to never look out the window, for if he sees his family, it will cause him great pain. Unfortunately, while Inaras was away, this is exactly what Hupasiyas did, and he begged Inaras to let him go home to his family. Inaras grows furious with this act of so-called hubris from Hupasiyas, however the consequences are unknown and we can only speculate.\n\nMeanwhile Inaras' epilogue involves another myth. The mother-goddess Hannahanna promises Inaras a man as well as land. However, Inaras would dissapear, starting a famous myth of Taru (or an unnamed Storm-God) to search for Inaras with the aid of Hannahanna and a bee. Scholars are quick to point out the similarities in this story and that of the Greek myth of Persephone and Demeter."

 deity_hannahanna:0 "$omen_hannahanna$"
 omen_hannahanna:0 "Hannahanna"
 omen_hannahanna_desc:0 "Hannahanna is most certainly not the originally name of the famous mother goddess, but rather the Hittite name, describing her role as 'grandmother.' She had a whole festival dedicated to her, the all-important Puruli festival, as well as a number of surviving myths; indicating her importance to the Hatti people before the Hittites.\n\nHannahanna's role in mythology seems to involve a number of mysterious disappearences. First, the famous Talipinu myth, where the storm-god Taru requests Hannahanna's help to find Talipinu. She dispatches a bee in order to find Talipinu, and the bee does indeed find him. In another myth, Inaras goes missing and once more Hannahanna sends the bee attendant to find her. Finally, in the third myth, Hannahanna herself goes missing, however this was indeed her intent. She was angered and left, causing the entirety of the land to suffer. Livestock suffocate, mothers stop caring for their children (both animals and humans), and only when she returns is order restored."

 deity_illuyanka:0 "$omen_illuyanka$"
 omen_illuyanka:0 "Illuyanka"
 omen_illuyanka_desc:0 "The serpent-dragon, Illuyanka, once threatened the great storm god Taru, however through the power of friendship and his own mightiness, Taru overcame Illuyanka, vanquishing him by way of death. The original Hattic narrative involves him being bound by the mortal lover of Inaras and then slain by Taru (or an unnamed storm god).\n\nWorshipping this devilish serpentine dragon would be quite unorthodox, however, perhaps his temptation of power will make it worth it."

 deity_kasku:0 "$omen_kasku$"
 omen_kasku:0 "Kasku"
 omen_kasku_desc:0 "Kasku, or 'The Shining Star,' is the god of the moon in the Hattic pantheon. In his myth, 'The Moon's Fall from the Heaven,' it says that Kasku descends (or falls) unto the market city of Lahzan. However, this angers the might Taru, who drenches Kasku in ferocious rains and winds. Katahziwuri notice the ruckus and performs a ritual in order to calm the angry god of the storms. In the Hittite and Luwian version of the myth, Katahziwuri does this with the help of Hapantali."

 deity_zaparwa:0 "$omen_zaparwa$"
 omen_zaparwa:0 "Zaparwa"
 omen_zaparwa_desc:0 "Zaparwa was the head of the Palaic pantheon, however, the Palaic people worshipped a pantheon adjacent to that of the Hatti, closer to them than they were to the Luwian-Hurrio-Hittite pantheon. His cult center was the city of Pala, later known as Paphlagonia. Because of his origins, Zaparwa was often compared to the Hattic-originated god, Talipinu, who was also a storm god and played a role in the myth of the disapearance of Talipinu. He was also considered a god of vegetation. Additionally, his connection to the rest of the Hattic main pantheon comes in the form of his consort, the Queen of the Land, Katahzipuri."

 deity_shulinkatte:0 "$omen_shulinkatte$"
 omen_shulinkatte:0 "Shulinkatte"
 omen_shulinkatte_desc:0 "Shulinkatte was known as the King of 'Shuli.' The Hattic word katte is well known to mean king, however shuli is unknown. Some believe the word to mean sword, however this is not yet provable. It would make sense though, as Shulinkatte was known as the war god of Nerik. Shulinkatte was actually considered the father of the storm god of Nerik, likely a local epithetal version of Taru, and was also worshipped in Hattusha. His main site of worship was the city of Tamarmara, however the origins and location of the area are sparsely attested. He is depicted with a sword and riding a lion."

 deity_hapantali:0 "$omen_hapantali$"
 omen_hapantali:0 "Hapantali"
 omen_hapantali_desc:0 "Hapantali, or Hapantaliya, is actually a goddess of Luwian origin, not Hattic origin. This is one of a few gods who enterred Hattic beliefs from Luwian and not the other way around. It should be noted that some scholars have suggested a Hattic origins, but most reject this idea outright. In her worship, she was seen as a shepard goddess, being responsible for the herd of sheep associated with the Luwian sun god, Tiwaz. In Hattic mythology, it is likely she served a role in calming down Talipinu and Hannahanna on two different occasions during the Disappearance of Talipinu and Disappearance of Hannahanna respectively. She often appears alongside Inaras, or as an attendent of Hannahanna."
