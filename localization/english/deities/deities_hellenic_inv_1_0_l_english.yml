The farmers would ask the oracle what had happened and what to do, however, the men who were to deliver the oracle's words were bribed by Ino to lie and tell the rest of the Boetians that the oracle claimed Phrixus and Helle should be sacrificed. Before they could be sacrificed though, they were saved by a swimming ram with the golden fleece. Unfortunately, during the travels on the ram, Helles would fall off and be cast into the waters that would henceforth be called the Hellespont.
