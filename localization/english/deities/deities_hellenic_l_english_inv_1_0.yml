Following this, the goddesses tried to win bribe Paris to choose them.\n\nHera offered political power; Athena promised infinite wisdom; and Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta.\n\nWhile Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, Paris chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued."

 deity_hydaspes:0 "$omen_hydaspes$"
 omen_hydaspes:0 "Hydaspos"
 omen_hydaspes_desc:0 "Hydaspos is the might god of the River Hydaspes, also called the Jhelum River. When Alexander marched his armies to the Indus and the King Porus fought against him, so too did the gods fight. In an epic tale, Hydaspos was described as fighting Dionysus as a representation of Porus versus Alexander. While this epic came in the fifth century CE, it is likely that the origins of a god Hydaspos started in the first century BCE. He is an embodiment of the river bearing the same name. He is also called the god of Pentapotamia."
