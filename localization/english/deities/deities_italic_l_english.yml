 omen_nethus_desc:0 "Nethuns was the god of wells, water, and the sea. It's quite possible that the name Nethuns is related to the Celtic god Nechtan. In fact, Nethuns may be from Indo-European origins, from the IE word for nephew. This clearly shows that Nethuns was not originally Etruscan, so it's likely it was one of the many gods adopted amongst Etruscans and central Italic peoples. Currently, it is believed that Nethuns came from Umbrian origin.Nethuns became Neptune to the Romans who was conflated with the Greek god Poseidon."
