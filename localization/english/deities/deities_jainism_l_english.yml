 omen_kalanos_desc:0 "The Gymnosophist from Taxila, Kalanos was an Indian ascetic who would accompany Alexander to Persis, before becoming weak at his old age and choosing to die self-immolation; suicide by fire. It is said that during his death, he did not flinch as he burned, and even said goodbye to his Greek pupils, although to Alexander he instead said that they would meet again in Babylon in a year. Alexander would die exactly one year later to malaria in the great city of Babylon. He was well respected by the Macedonian conquerers and when they first met, Kalanos instructed Alexander to strip naked or else he would not speak to him. In general, Kalanos approved of many aspects of Greek philosophy, though critiqued their use of clothing.\n\nKalanos was thought by some to have been a Jain sage due to his attitude, gymnosophism (nudity), and parts of his philosophies, however that is rejected nowadays due to the nature of his death violating Sallekhana, the oath to die by starvation, as well as the fact that the shramanic presence in Taxila was quite rare at the time.\n\nHis name may actually be closer to Sphines, according to Plutarch, with Kalanos coming from 'Kale' (Kallana mitta), meaning 'Greetings, friend.'"

The gymnosophists who lived naked in the jungle, lying on leaves next to a spring, were trouble to Alexander, and he sent Onescratus to bring the leader, Dandamis, to Alexander. Onescratus offered gold and rewards if he complied, otherwise he promised death by the hands of Alexander, the son of Zeus. However, Dandamis retorted that the Great God of the Universe is a provider of life, not a bringer of death, and refused to even lift his head. Alexander then came himself to the Svami, and after much refusal to offer Alexander anything, Alexander mentioned the name of Kalanos, the once-student of Dandamis. The conversation that followed is known as the Alexander-Dandamis Colloquy, and is said to have deeply humbled the great king."

 deity_philozoia:0 "$omen_philozoia$"
 omen_philozoia:0 "Pythagoreanism"
 omen_philozoia_desc:0 "Pythagoreanism may have been influenced by Indian shramanic philosophies, with many key concepts serving as key branches of the philosophy. Most directly for Jainism, the idea of the Pythagrean Diet is quite apt, in which the consumption of animals violates the sanctity of life itself. The Pythagorean idea of metempsychosis too is very similar to the Indian idea of samsara, where humans and animals are connected through reincarnation. Furthermore, while not directly the same, violence is seen in Pythagoreanism to represent a disruptive force to 'Kosmos,' or the Universe, which bears similarity to the idea of negative Karma. Finally, both traditions link non-violence to purity."
