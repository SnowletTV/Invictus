One day, Sobek appeared to the people who lived along the river and offered to help them. He used his immense strength to dig a deep channel in the riverbed, allowing the Nile to flow freely and provide water for the people's crops. In gratitude for his help, the people of Egypt began to worship Sobek as a powerful god who could control the Nile's waters.
