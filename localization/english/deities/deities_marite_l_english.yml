 # New Deities #
 deity_lurraberri:0 "$omen_lurraberri$"
 omen_lurraberri:0 "Lurraberri"
 omen_lurraberri_desc:0 "Lurraberri's name means 'new soil' and it was often proceeded by the epithet 'Anderexi' which means 'flowering.' It's possible this indicates Lurraberri may have been a fertility god, or perhaps even a tree or flower god. It may also mean he was a god of rebirth. Lurraberri was listed on an inscription that read his name as Ilurriberrixus Anderexi, a Romanized version of Lurraberri."
 deity_orko:0 "$omen_orko$"
 omen_orko:0 "Orko"
 omen_orko_desc:0 "Orko was a god of thunder. His name was used in the Basque word for Thursday, Orkoguna, relating him to gods such as Thunraz/Thor and Jupiter/Zeus. It's possible that the god was a minor deity before Roman influence, but the significance of naming a day after him shows he may have been of great importance to the Basques."
 deity_lobegi:0 "$omen_lobegi$"
 omen_lobegi:0 "Lobegi"
 omen_lobegi_desc:0 "Lobegi's name comes from an inscription that read 'Lacobegius,' which seems to be a Romanized version of a Basque god. As the root 'laco' clearly comes from the Latin 'lacus (lake)'' it's possible that the original root was something closer to 'lo,' the Basque word for lake, or perhaps something different. Regardless, the second part of his name, begi, means eyes. So his name translates to 'Eyes of the Lake.' This may indicate that Lobegi was a sort of water-based wisdom deity."
 deity_sorginak:0 "$omen_sorginak$"
 omen_sorginak:0 "Sorginak"
 omen_sorginak_desc:0 "The sorginak were not one deity, or deities at all. Instead, they were mystical beings and people who were often said to be witches in later time periods. They practiced magic and could cause all sorts of boons or banes. Some sorginak were also said to be laminak, which were fertility nymphs."
 deity_inguma:0 "$omen_inguma$"

 deity_aiko:0 "$omen_aiko$"
 omen_aiko:0 "Aiko"
 omen_aiko_desc:0 "Aiko is the son of Mari and the hero of the Basque people. His legend states that he was the one who established Basque culture and religion and was a hero of many feats. Such a character credited with the origin of the Basques themselves could have been worshiped since pre-Roman times if not earlier."
 deity_laminak:0 "$omen_laminak$"
 omen_laminak:0 "Laminak"
 omen_laminak_desc:0 "The laminak were female spirits, or nymphs, of sex and fertility. They were said to have helped women through childbirth, fertility, and good health. Laminak were not always portrayed as good spirits as in one myths, they capture the goddess Mari."
 deity_urtzi:0 "$omen_urtzi$"
 omen_urtzi:0 "Urtzi"
 omen_urtzi_desc:0 "Urtzi has an interesting case for existence. Many argue that Urtzi must have been a sky god as many names, places, and words seem to bear the root of Urtzi, as well as some outside sources claim that the Mariite religion was home to such a sky god, however some scholars believe that Urtzi is actually just a word for sky. It is possible that both hypothesis are true, however, we may also never know the truth behind this mystery."
