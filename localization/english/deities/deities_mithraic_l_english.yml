 omen_mithra_desc:0 "Mithra is a Mithraic Divinity embraced by certain elements of Hellenistic society, and he is associated with truth, harvest, and plays a role in the ceremonies for the strengthening of the water.\n\nSpreading far beyond his Persian homeland, the worship of Mithra specifically has been picked up by those outside of the faith.

 omen_cyrus:0 "Cyrus the Great"
 omen_cyrus_desc:0 "In 600 BCE, a Persian boy would be born into a world dominated by the Neo-Babylonians, Late Egyptians, Lydians, and Medians. By the time of his death in 530 BCE, a mere 70 years, the world had been changed forever. This is Cyrus the Great, conquerer of the known world 200 years before anyone knew the name of Alexander.\n\nCyrus, apart from his legendary military conquests, was also a great statesman. His policies and openness to religion allowed his empire, unlike that of a certain Greek's, to reign for hundreds of years after his death. In doing so, he achieved an impossible status as a crusader of his faith, Mazdaism (Zoroastrianism) while simultaneously becoming a mythic hero of Mithraic beliefs."

 omen_shoithrapati:0 "Shoithrapati"
 omen_shoithrapati_desc:0 "Shoithrapati was a campground deity favored among the semi-nomad tribes of Media. Although just conjecture, it's possible that due to her lack of widespreadedness in the cities, the deity persisted in the rural areas longer than the Mithraic faith did itself in certain areas due to isolation."

 deity_vata:0 "$omen_vata$"
 omen_vata:0 "Vayu-Vata"
 omen_vata_desc:0 "The dual-faced deity Vayu-Vata was popular especially within Zurvanite Zoroastrianism. Vayu was the face of the wind, and Vata the face of the atmosphere. In Mazdaic Zoroastrianism, Vayu-Vata was both an avesta and a daeva, both an angel and a devil. In Zurvanite Zoroastrianism, Vayu-Vata was instead representative of Zurvan, and thus associated with time and space."

 omen_angra_mainyu_desc:0 "The destructive power and twin of Spenta Mainyu, Angra Mainyu is the son of Ahura Mazda and the evil side of the dualistic beliefs rooted in Mazdaism as well as other Zoroastrian branches. His epithet of 'Druj' means 'The Lie,' and it represents his greed, wrath, and envy; all of which he uses against Spenta Mainyu, who represented light and creation.\n\nDespite these evil undertones, he had a small cult within Mithraic beliefs. Perhaps a 'Cult of Chaos' it was, to his worshipers, they must have found good in the traditionally demon-esque deity."
