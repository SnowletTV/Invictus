 omen_cyrus:0 "Cyrus the Great"
 omen_cyrus_desc:0 "In 600 BCE, a Persian boy would be born into a world dominateed by the Neo-Babylonians, Late Egyptians, Lydians, and Medians. By the time of his death in 530 BCE, a mere 70 years, the world had been changed forever. This is Cyrus the Great, conquerer of the known world 200 years before anyone knew the name of Alexander.\n\nCyrus, apart from his legendary military conquests, was also a great statesman. His policies and openness to religion allowed his empire, unlike that of a certain Greek's, to reign for hundreds of years after his death. In doing so, he achieved an impossible status as a crusader of his faith, Mazdaism (Zoroastrianism) while simultaneously becoming a mythic hero of Mithraic beliefs."

 omen_shoithrapati:0 "Shoithrapati"
 omen_shoithrapati_desc:0 "Shoithrapati was a campground deity favored among the semi-nomad tribes of Media. Although just conjecture, it's possible that due to her lack of widespreadedness in the cities, the deity persisted in the rural areas longer than the Mithraic faith did itself in certain areas due to isolation."

In Mazdaic Zoroastrianism, Vayu-Vata was both an avesta and a daeva, both an angel and a devil. In Zurvanite Zoroastrianism, Vayu-Vata was instead representative of Zurvan, and thus associated with time and space."

His epithet of 'Druj' means 'The Lie,' and it represents his greed, wrath, and envy; all of which he uses against Spenta Mainyu, who represented light and creation.\n\nDespite these evil undertones, he had a small cult within Mithraic beliefs. Perhaps a 'Cult of Chaos' it was, to his worshipers, they must have found good in the traditionally demon-esque deity."
