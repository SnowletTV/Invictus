 omen_batraz_desc:0 "The greatest warrior of the Narts, as well as their leader. He is comparible to the southern Caucasian 'Amirani' in role. His sword is an important symbol of iron and his power, although his primary association is as a god of storms.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Bartaz was born to a Khami, whose wife would give Khami a cyst-like burning bubble on his back for Bartaz to grow onto before leaving. Once Bartaz was born, still on fire, the Nart Syrdon would cast him into the sea where he would grow up. Later, Bartaz would visit the blacksmith-god Kurdalaegon, who heats Bartaz, giving him powers, and then throws him into the sea with tongs. Bartaz goes on from there to live in the skies, hurling thunderbolts to aid the Narts. Many great feats would be achieved by him in life, including enacting a glorious vengeance upon the crooked giant who was causing violence among the young people of the Narts. He is also found of boasting games, in which he usually wins. Bartaz would ultimately die in path to vengeance for his father's death, which resulted in the death of many other Narts."
