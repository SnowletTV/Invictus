 deity_tasmisu:0 "$omen_tasmisu$"

He is one of four warrior gods, along with the Hurrian gods Ashtabil and Heshui, as well as Mesopotamian god Nergal.\n\nTasmishu's relationship with Teshub seems as one of a younger brother. Often addressing Teshub as 'my lord,' and considered to be the 'pure brother' of Teshub. Like Teshub and their sister Shaushka, Tasmishu comes from the union of Anu and Kumarbi.\n\nInterestingly, Tasmishu in Hurio-Hittite mythos is often associated with Shuwaliyatti, showing a small, but interesting, distinction between Hurrio-Hittite and Hurrio-Syrian versions of general Hurrian mythos, although it is also possible that Shuwaliyatti comes from Hittite and was later absorbed into Hurrian beliefs, resulting in a strange overlap of the roles of Tasmishu and Shuwaliyatti. The two gods also had active differences in the nature of their belief, as Tasmishu was never worshipped with vegetation unlike his Hittite counterpart."
 deity_kubaba:0 "$omen_kubaba$"
 omen_kubaba:0 "Kubaba"
 omen_kubaba_desc:0 "Kubaba was a goddess in the Hurrian pantheon from Syria. She should not be confused or related to the Queen Kubaba of Kish as Kubaba the Hurrian goddess is a distinct figure. Her name's etymology is unknown, however it has been deemed that her name is not of Semetic origin, nor of Sumerian origin. Many attempts have been made to link her to the earlier mentioned Queen Kubaba of Kish, the Phrygian goddess Cybele, and the Assyrian god Gubaba, however none have been fruitful comparisons, with the closest linking possibility being the Assyrian Gubaba possibly being a masculinized version of Kubaba.\n\nIn Hurrian mythology, she is only mentioned scarcely. It has been proposed that she is a 'civic' deity. She was depicted, in one mural, holding a mirror and a pomegranate. Because of her association in Luwain with the symbol for birds, it is assumed she is associated with birds, however there has been no depiction of her with any type of birds, only adding to the list of questions abouot this mysterious Hurrian goddess."
 deity_allani:0 "$omen_allani$"
 omen_allani:0 "Allani"

 omen_pirinki:0 "Piriniki"

In Elamite, the deity was an astral goddess related to the planet Venus, known as the Mistress of Heaven. It is likely that the Hurrian version of this goddess was closer to the Mesopotamian understanding of Piriniki, which related her the Ishtar, giving Piriniki a role as a goddess of sex and war."

 omen_tadmish:0 "Tadmish"
 omen_tadmish_desc:0 "Tadmish, or Dadmish, was a goddess worshipped in Ugarit. While her origin lays in Syria, she became popular in Hurrian mythology. She is assumed to be a goddess of healing.

Interesting, despite active worship, she is missing from any Ugarit myths or stories."
 deity_irshappa:0 "$omen_irshappa$"
 omen_irshappa:0 "Irshappa"
 omen_irshappa_desc:0 "Irshappa was the Hurrian version of the popular god, Resheph. Originally a Syrian god, versions of Resheph were worshipped prominently in Egypt, the Mediterranian, the Levant, and in Hurrian tradition. Although it's not universally accepted, the name Resheph may have some etymological relations to Hurrian language, implying he may have originally been at least influenced by Hurrian tradition rather than a purely Syrian god.\n\nHurrian faith places him amongst the large circle of the lead god, Teshub. He was considerred a god of trade, an aspect that seems to originally formed in the Hurrian belief of him."
