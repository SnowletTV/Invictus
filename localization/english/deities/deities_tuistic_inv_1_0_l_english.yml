 omen_mannus:1 "Mannuz"
 omen_mannus_desc:3 "Called Mannus by Tacitus, Mannuz was our forefather Twisto's son and himself gave birth to three sons who would then spread and settle the world. He is therefore also the ancestor of all Germanic people, although some tribes maintain that there were more sons of his, namely their very own forefathers. As the first being to possess human virility, as such he is revered as its symbol and patron."

 omen_yngvi_desc:3 "Our lord, in Germanic Frawjaz (becoming Freyr in Old Norse), Ingwaz is one of Mannuz's sons and progenitor of the Ingvaeones. The Norwegian kings would later trace back their lineage to the god of prosperity they called Yngvi."

 omen_gautr:1 "Gautaz"
 omen_gautr_desc:3 "Gautaz, to pour, is one of the many names of Wodenaz (known to the Norse as Odin) and the first mentioned name from Roman sources. He is often depicted together with two ravens that tell him about all events on earth (called Huginn and Muninn in Old Norse), and one-eyed, as he sacrificed it to gain even more wisdom."

 deity_thunraz:0 "$omen_thunraz$"
 omen_thunraz:1 "Thunraz"
 omen_thunraz_desc:3 "A hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of mankind and also hallowing and fertility, Donar, known centuries later to the Norse Vikings as Thor, was a Germanic god of major significance. \n\nHistorically, the earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Donar/Thor is frequently referred to – via a process known as interpretatio romana (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) – as the Greco-Roman god Hercules. \n\n Donar/Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high popularity during the Viking Age."

 deity_tiwaz:0 "$omen_tiwaz$"
 omen_tiwaz:1 "Tiwaz"
 omen_tiwaz_desc:3 "Tiwaz, an early form of what would later be the Norse God Tyr, was a Germanic war god of significant importance. In Norse mythology, from which most surviving narratives about gods among the Germanic peoples stem, he sacrifices his hand to the monstrous wolf Fenrir, who bites off his limb while the gods bind the animal, and he is foretold of being consumed by the similarly monstrous dog Garmr during the events of Ragnarök.\n\nWhile Tiwaz's etymological heritage reaches back to the Proto-Indo-European period, connecting him to Zeus and Jupiter, very few direct references to the god survive prior to the Old Norse period. Like many other non-Roman deities, Tiwaz receives mention in Latin texts by way of the process of interpretatio romana, in which Latin texts refer to the god by way of a perceived counterpart in Roman mythology, through which he is identified with Mars."

 deity_wodenaz:0 "$omen_wodenaz$"
 omen_wodenaz:1 "Wodenaz"
 omen_wodenaz_desc:3 "An early form of the Norse God Odin, Wodenaz was a widely revered god in Germanic mythology. Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about him, associates him with wisdom, healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and projects him as the husband of the goddess Frigg. \n\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works he is frequently referred to—via a process known as interpretatio romana (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity)—as the Roman god Mercury. \n\nThe first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus's late 1st-century work Germania, where, writing about the religion of the Suebi (a confederation of Germanic peoples), he comments that ''among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims.''"

 omen_wulthuz:1 "Wulthuz"
 omen_wulthuz_desc:3 "Wulthuz, or Ullr in Norse mythology, was a Germanic god of notable importance. He was a god associated with winter, hunting, and archery. He was said to be an excellent skier, and was often depicted wearing skis and carrying a bow. Some sources also connect him with oath-taking and justice do to his name, Wulthuz, meaning glory and justice.\n\nWhile much knowledge of the god in question has been lost, due to the memory of Wulthuz having faded by the time the extant sources were composed (possibly indicating that he may have been older than the other Norse gods, thus could have come from earlier versions of the mythos.)"

 omen_frijjo:1 "Frijjo"
 omen_frijjo_desc:3 "A Germanic Goddess associated with foresight and wisdom, Frijjo, or as she would later be known by the Norse, Frigg was the wife of Odin. \n\nEarly possible historical mention of her exists from the Romans interactions with the Germanic peoples by way of the process of interpretatio romana, in which Latin texts refer to the god by way of a perceived counterpart in Roman mythology, comparing her to the Goddess Isis, although it should be noted that this historical mention may have instead refered to the goddess Frawjo, known later to the Norse as Freyja. \n\nScholars debate whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples. While this is possible and they share many attributes, it is only one theory and others pose that they did indeed originate from two different goddesses."

Freyja rules over her heavenly field, Fólkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle, the other half going to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. \n\nEarly possible historical mention of her exists from the Romans interactions with the Germanic peoples by way of the process of interpretatio romana, in which Latin texts refer to the god by way of a perceived counterpart in Roman mythology, comparing her to the Goddess Isis, although it should be noted that this could have instead refered to the goddess Frijjo, known later to the Norse as Frigg. \n\nScholars debate whether the goddess Freyja and Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples.

 deity_halja:0 "$omen_halja$"
 omen_halja:1 "Halja"
 omen_halja_desc:3 "Halja, known later to the Norse as Hel, was a Germanic Goddess of Death and ruler of the underworld, which shares her name. While the only surviving historical information derives from her later Norse incarnation of Hel, there is possible early evidence of her dating back to the Roman Era centuries before. \n\nIt has been suggested that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Germanic Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of her. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Halja."

 deity_haimadallaz:0 "$omen_haimadallaz$"
 omen_haimadallaz:0 "Haimadallaz"
 omen_haimadallaz_desc:0 "Haimadallaz is a name for the old deity in Old Germanic paganism who was the equivalent to the Norse god Heimdallr. While we do not know what the germanics would have called this god, there is evidence to suggest that Heimdallr was a revered god from long before the Norse pantheon diverged from the Germanic pantheon.\n\nBased on assumptions from Norse mythology, Haimadallaz was associated with guarding and protecting the home of the gods. His name, in fact, seems to take root in this idea as 'haimaz' means home and 'dallaz' means tree, thus he is the protector of the home of the gods and the world tree.\n\nWhile not all scholars agree, it has been put fourth that Haimadallaz could have also been a god of sexuality and fertility. This is based on his association with the phallic symbol of the ram and association with the world tree, which is a tree of life. This is further supplemented with the word 'dallr' sometimes being associated with the goddess of fertility, Frijjo."

 omen_luk:1 "Luko"
 omen_luk_desc:3 "A very possible early incarnation of the Norse God Loki, the Germanic god Luko (although the etymology of the name Loki has been extensively debated, it is believed its origin is in the Germanic root Luk ''lock'') a god whose origins and role in mythology have been fiercely debated by scholars, some of whom have described him as that of a trickster god, while others have theorized, he may have served as a god of the Hearth/Fire, similar to the Greek Goddess Hestia. \n\nWhile little solid evidence of his early Germanic existence has been found during this period in history like with other Norse gods, it is believed by some scholars that he likely may have existed by this point, due to his later importance in Norse Mythology."

 omen_baloraz_desc:3 "A god in Germanic mythology, Baldraz was an early incarnation of the Norse god Baldr, who was the son of Odin and Frigg and is the god of light, joy, purity, and the summer sun. In later Norse myth, the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök. \n\nHe has sometimes been compared with the Greco-Roman Apollo, for whom similar characteristics exist. \n\nWhile little solid evidence of his early Germanic existence has been found during this period in history like with other Norse gods, it is believed by some scholars that he likely may have existed by this point, due to his later importance in Norse Mythology."
