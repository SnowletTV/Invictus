 omen_zichos_desc:0 "Zichosa is a reconstructed Thracian word to represent the Snake-Legged Goddess of the Thracians. The Thracians worshipped this Snake-Legged Goddess but left no remains to her true name. She was likely a goddess inherited from the Scythians who too had an unnamed Snake-Legged Goddess. Zichosa is often depicted as a tall woman with snake-like tendrils from her head and hair."

The Greeks described her as a 'strange' goddess. Some identify her with Ares and derive her name as meaning 'ablaze.' This may also relate her to Hephaestus."

 omen_kotyto_desc:0 "Kotytia, also known as Cotytia and Kotyto, was a goddess of sex and was associated with orgasmic rituals. It's possible that she may have came from a celebration of the rape of Persephone, celebrated by the Edoni Thracians, before spreading to the Greeks. For the Greeks, her worship became widespread enough to where the phrase 'Companion of Kotyttia' became synonymous with 'slut.'"

 omen_tis:0 "Tis"
 omen_tis_desc:0 "Tis, also called Zis, was the son of Bendis and possibly the Dacian version of sky-god present in many Indo-European peoples' pantheons. Tis was equated with many, many foreign gods (Dionysus, Hermes, Apollo, Ares), possibly indicating that Tis was an ancient god of the people, and thus simple enough to relate to any new god. In fact, it is likely that Tis was the universal god amongst the Thracian and Dacian peoples. He was also known as a god of many faces (usually three), and a horseman god."

Some sources say that Thrax is an epithet or a primordial name of Ares himself as the patron of the Thracians. For this reason, the temple in Bistonia in Thrace kept the gilded shield of Ares within it."
