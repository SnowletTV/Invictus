 omen_zurvan_khusmani_desc:0 "#Y Aspect of Zurvan#! \nZurvan of Materialism was a popular form of Zurvanism, the most popular perhaps. Materialistic Zurvanism gave challenge to the idea of something being made from nothing. Materialistic Zurvanism instead says that the spiritual world did not exist, nor did the idea of Ahura Mazda creating the world with his thought."

 omen_zurvan_zahd_desc:0 "#Y Aspect of Zurvan#! \nZurvan of Asceticism, a much less popular form of Zurvanism, yet still just as interesting. Ascetic Zurvanism saw Zurvan as undifferentiated time, divided into masculine reason and feminine concupiscence."

 omen_zurvan_bakt:0 "Bakt-i Zurvan"
 omen_zurvan_bakt_desc:0 "#Y Aspect of Zurvan#! \nZurvan of Fatalism, or the idea that the amount of time Zurvan had allotted to Ahriman was limited. This would mean nothing can challenge fate, and humans must follow a predetermined path or a destiny as ordained by the stars."
