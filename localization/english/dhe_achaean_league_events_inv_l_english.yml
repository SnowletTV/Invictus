When the other city-states banded into leagues and alliances to fight one another, Corinth stubbornly stuck to its independence. During the wars of the Diadochi, the ancient city-state was turned into little more than a glorified fortification for the Macedonian troops, becoming the most strategic defensive position in the region.\n\nOur struggle with [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetPraenomen]' descendants for control of Greece continues, but [aratus_scope.GetName] has at last cast out the Macedonian garrison from the city of [GetProvince('(int32)418').GetName] and our troops now march through its streets."

Even our own Keryneia and Bura now lie in the hands of demagogues. The league's councils no longer reach a quorum and thus its decrees cannot be ratified.\n\n Some argue that the koinon should be placed in abeyance for a time. They say it is wiser better to preserve what unity remains than to allow our league to be corrupted by foreign puppets. Others insist that the koinon must endure, whatever the cost. If we do suspend our institutions, each free city must fend for itself until a brighter hour returns."
