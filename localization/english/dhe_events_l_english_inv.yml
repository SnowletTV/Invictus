  dhe_city_fall.1.desc_2:0 "In the Great Green, a war of vengeance raged between the Carthaginians and the Nuragics. We have been driven by generations of oppression, sought to reclaim our freedom and honor. As the siege of Carthage commenced, our generals led the Nuragic forces with unwavering determination. The battle was fierce, with both sides fighting fiercely for their cause.\n\nThe walls of Carthage stood strong, but our horned warriors were relentless. The Nuragic strategic brilliance and our warriors' indomitable spirit slowly chipped away the city's defenses. Amidst the chaos of the battle, a daring plan emerged. Under the cover of night, a group of valiant punic-speaking scouts infiltrated the city, sabotaging the Carthaginians' supply lines and morale. We have used their language against them.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, our plan sought it's fruits and the Carthaginian resistance managed to crumble under our feets. At the apogee of the battle, our leadership united it's people, recalling the memories of old and our ancient chants of battle, forging an unbreakable bond that would determine the outcome of the siege. The decisive day arrived when the Nuragics breached Carthage's walls, unleashing a wave of triumph in the name of our ancestors and our sole God.\n\nNow it's up to our wise King to choose the fate of our enemy of old, shall we cowardly leave them untouched filling our hearts with a feeling of injustice, or shall we reclaim the memory of our ancestors? Our people, our navy, our army, have faith in our decision, we cannot disappoint them."
