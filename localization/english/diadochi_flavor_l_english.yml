 diadochi_flavor.78.desc:0 "Established at the beginning of the fifth century BC, Hellespontine Phrygia was ruled by descendants of Pharnaces, an uncle of King Darius I the Great, with its capital located at Dascylium. During the campaign of Alexander the Great in 334 BC, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Arsites, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Granicus River, after which he committed suicide. Alexander appointed Calas as his successor. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, a member of the royal house of Lyncestis in Macedonia and one of Alexander's trusted bodyguards. Alexander's sister Cleopatra, the widow of King Alexander I of Epirus, offered her hand in marriage to Leonnatus, a union that would have strengthened his claim to power. Had he defeated the Athenians, Leonnatus may very well have attempted to seize the Macedonian throne for himself. His career was cut short during the Lamian War, where he led a force of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to relieve Antipater during the siege of Lamia. Despite his likely ambitions to challenge Antipater's authority and potentially marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra, Leonnatus was killed in battle, leaving his aspirations unfulfilled.\n\nControl of the satrapy then passed to Arrhidaeus, who held it until the Partition of Triparadisus (321 BC), after which Clitus the White was assigned as satrap. Clitus' rule was brief. He was defeated and killed in 317 BC by Arrhidaeus. His successor, Ardys, governed for an uncertain period before power shifted again. Phoenix of Tenedos, a loyal subordinate of Antigonus, governed the region for a time, followed by Antigonos' nephew Polemaios, another of Antigonus’ generals. However, after the compelled suicide of Polemaios, the satrapy has been defunct.\n\nNow control of Hellespontine Phrygia has fallen to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]. While we could follow Antigonus' example and simply absorb the satrapy, we have an opportunity to establish a new powerbase for our dynasty. [attalid_head.GetPraenomen]'s proposal for Asia to be ruled by a governor or even a king with strong local connections was inspired, but [attalid_head.GetPraenomen] was clearly not suited for such a task. [agathocles_scope.GetPraenomen] is incredibly popular with our Asian subjects and is undoubtedly one of our most adept administrators. [agathocles_scope.GetPraenomen] has always been a steadfast supporter of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]. Since the blood of Alkimachus runs his veins, his loyalty to our dynasty is beyond question.
