#event locs
disasters_inv.1.t:0 "Floodings in [the_day_after.GetName]"
disasters_inv.1.desc:0 "The water levels in [the_day_after.GetName] have risen to unprecedented highs! Many have fled their homes, abandoning their entire livelihoods in their desperation to escape, but many have died already and we fear that these numbers will continue to grow. Needless to say, production in the area has fallen to an all-time low; the once-benevolent and fertile river that brought prosperity to [the_day_after.GetName] now only brings ruin and devastation."
disasters_inv.1.a:0 "We must prepare the surrounding areas should the flood propagate."
disasters_inv.1.b:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."
disasters_inv.2.t:0 "The Flood Expands"
disasters_inv.2.desc:0 "The nightmare continues, for the flood in [the_day_after.GetName] has expanded and now encroaches on the neighboring settlements, which were already swelled to bursting with refugees from the disaster. The local governor from the region reports that we have the situation under control, however. Whilst the damage isn't as bad as we initially feared, it will take time until the area can function fully again. Worse yet, the inhabitants have decreased in number, which means that the productivity will be lower than before."
disasters_inv.2.a:0 "May the gods have mercy on us."
disasters_inv.3.t:0 "The Floods Recede"
disasters_inv.3.desc:0 "The flood is receding, at long last. While we have lost so much, there still remains hope - truly our people are indomitable. The inhabitants of [the_day_after.GetName] have started to return, rebuilding their homes. It will be a very long time before [the_day_after.GetName] fully recovers, however; much work remains to be done, but thankfully, the people have the appetite for it. May we pray that no such an event will occur in our lifetimes again."
disasters_inv.3.a:0 "The worst is over."
disasters_inv.4.t:0 "An Avalanche"
disasters_inv.4.desc:0 "We have received news of a calamity! An avalanche hit [snowball.GetName] and caused great damage to life and property; the local roads are impassable, due to the sheer amount of snow that has fallen, and we have heard reports that local infrastructure has been damaged. Until [snowball.GetName] is rebuilt, not many will want to live or work there. \nNot far away, there has recently been another avalanche. Maybe they are connected? If people start to believe these lands are cursed, no one will ever want to live there. What is causing these avalanches? It is said that vibrations may de-clench one - the cries of help surely are to be considered."
disasters_inv.4.a:0 "May their souls rest in peace."
disasters_inv.5.t:0 "A Landslide"
disasters_inv.5.desc:0 "Misery upon misery! We have terrible news from [mudstick.GetName], which has been suffering from bad weather. It has been raining for weeks, and we have heard reports that a tremendous landslide has now ruined the surrounding countryside. Tenacious as ever, the local residents are trying to rescue each other and are burying their dead, but the scale of the problem is too vast for their meager resources. Passage through the territory has become difficult for any traveler, drying up trade, and the broken, mud-spattered buildings aren't pretty to look at. Something should be done."
disasters_inv.5.a:0 "We must prepare for more!"
disasters_inv.5.b:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."
disasters_inv.6.t:0 "A Second Wave"
disasters_inv.6.desc_1:0 "This morning, another landslide hit [mudstick.GetName]. However, you will be pleased to hear that our preparations bore fruit and no substantial losses were incurred. The people are thankful that they have such a wise and loving leader, one who cares for all of the inhabitants of our realm equally."
disasters_inv.6.desc_2:0 "We should have listened to the wise advice that we so rashly ignored. Had we done something, anything, to help the poor inhabitants of [mudstick.GetName] after the last landslides came, then perhaps we wouldn't have an even larger problem to deal with now. As was predicted, another landslide has wreaked havoc in the region, causing even more loss of life. While the lives of [mudstick.GetName] aren't as precious as those of our own people, we do not have the luxury or necessity to waste them."
disasters_inv.6.a:0 "Luckily, we were prepared"
disasters_inv.6.b:0 "Patience is a virtue we don't have."

disasters_inv.7.desc:0 "[i_am_thirsty.GetName] experiences a time of extreme water scarcity. The grounds are bone-dry, swollen and cracked, making farming nigh impossible, and now merchants are starting to avoid the area, knowing they will not make good profits in the deserted markets. Water has become so scarce that the first fights over its ownership have erupted - you have heard reports of mobs guarding the dwindling wells in their villages, making sure that no stranger steals what was once freely given. Luckily, the surrounding area still has water resources that we could command be shared - this would make many unhappy, however. We have to decide what we prioritize."

The price of bread has quadrupled, when one can find it, and there is a thriving black market for stolen foodstuffs despite our best efforts to stamp them out. Starving peasants are turning to banditry, compounding the situation. The lack of water is killing everything and everyone; not even camels, the resilient beasts, are immune to it. There is no good news to be found here."

Ships are sinking in the harbors, unable to withstand the fury of the waves which now carry the bodies of drowned sailors to our shores. Many are mourning their relatives who died in the event, searching the beaches for lost loved ones - truly a grim task. [stormy_daniels.GetName]'s citizens have rallied, however, to move past this horrendous event and rebuild their town; they are an inspiration to us all."

Everyone has basically hunkered down where they are, waiting for the cursed sands to stop their infernal blowing.

The storm hinders any and all movement; not even the most stubborn of mules can pass through the thick layer of snow blanketing the land. [not_snowden.GetName]'s citizens now sit at home, trying to not freeze to death. This has brought all production to a halt, except for the barest of housework."
disasters_inv.11.a:0 "The gods are moody."
disasters_inv.12.t:0 "Locust Swarm Sighted"
disasters_inv.12.desc:0 "A swarm of locusts was sighted in [we_are_hungry.GetName]. Their numbers are so great that it is said the sun cannot be seen in the skies when they pass through, but this cannot be true. Still, the reports are disturbing; they have been eating everything that came into their sight, traveling from field to field, town to town. We should keep an eye on the situation, but right now, it doesn't appear to be a full-fledged disaster."
disasters_inv.12.a:0 "We have to act now, while there is time."
disasters_inv.12.b:0 "It's only some bugs."
disasters_inv.13.t:0 "Locust Swarm is Growing"
disasters_inv.13.desc:0 "We are being invaded, but by an army of insects! The swarm that was first sighted in [we_are_hungry.GetName] has spread to neighboring villages, their blight hindering the supply of food. The distressed farmers are begging for your assistance, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]; they sound absolutely terrified in the messages we are receiving."
disasters_inv.13.a:0 "We have to act, now!"
disasters_inv.13.b:0 "They know nothing."
disasters_inv.14.t:0 "The Locust Plague"
disasters_inv.14.desc:0 "The locust swarm from [we_are_hungry.GetName] has now become bigger and bigger - the massive horde has even split into a few smaller ones, all hunting for food. Every settlement in the vicinity of [we_are_hungry.GetName] has been stripped of every inch of plant material. Some of the stories you have been hearing are insane; people venturing out of their houses are having the literal clothes eaten off of their backs. The cattle, the people, the wildlife - everyone and everything is now starving, and some people are dying. We have to find a solution now, should we want to see next winter."
disasters_inv.14.a:0 "Better late than never."
disasters_inv.14.b:0 "We will survive it as is."
disasters_inv.15.t:0 "The Locusts are gone"
disasters_inv.15.desc:0 "The newest reports coming out of [we_are_hungry.GetName] and the surrounding area indicate that the locusts have mostly disappeared. The danger of a locust plague is no longer pending, but it will be a while before the region completely recovers. Hopefully, the damnable creatures are now in the lands of our enemies...may they never return!"
disasters_inv.15.a:0 "Finally!"
