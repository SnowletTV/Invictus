Not everyone was so fortunate as to be able to get away however. Some prominent slave owners were dragged out into the grand square and crucified.

No sane commander would have taken an army at such a pace through such lands… or that is what conventional wisdom would have us think. Evidence however shows us that it has worked, despite the attached dangers, and the enemy was taken by surprise by this sudden appearance. As the commander said in his last message before the battle, “I will either find a way, or make one”. "

Other nations squabble with phalanxes and horsebound infantry, but once the elephants charge the brave fall and the smart runs for their lives. With this victory at hand we are sure that [actor.GetName] will put even more focus into these noble beasts for our future war efforts."

 distinction.15.desc:0 "A remarkable victory has been achieved by [actor.GetName] after a crushing victory against the pompous Greeks and their phalanx. Had Alexander seen the sloppiness of their movement, weakness of the guards for the flanks and slow reactions to our tactics he would have wept. With this great victory we will take the glory of the silver shields for ourselves as we now have the most proficient heavy infantry in the world."

 distinction.18.desc:0 "In a battle, being methodical and having a good plan will make what might otherwise look like an even match turn into a one sided matter. As shown in their latest victory, [actor.GetName] has shown that they might even be able to push the ocean itself back with their resolve. As the enemy came with all their might, trying to push into our lines, they were time after time rebuffed. With each attack, our shields held strong and the enemies fell to our blades as they were pushed into close quarters. Today’s glorious victory will live on and guide the way forward for this army!"
 distinction.18.a:0 "They are an example for us all."
 distinction.19.t:0 "Fulminous Victory"
 distinction.19.desc:0 "Many battles are won with strategy, others with bravery, and some by intervention from the heavens. As [actor.GetName] was fighting, things were looking grim as the enemy made steady gains without our men being able to push them back. As the wind picked up, the enemy’s resolve started to falter whereas we were certain that this was the gods lending us a hand. When the lightning struck the enemy army the battle was over, not a man among them brave enough to stand up to the will of the gods. With this, [actor.GetName] will now fly the thunderbolt as part of their legacy."

 distinction.20.t:0 "Logistical Marvel"
 distinction.20.desc:0 "An army walks on its stomach, this is something every competent commander is well aware of. Assigning designated foraging parties as part of the soldier's daily tasks has done wonders for how long the army's rations last. It seems that the commander of [actor.GetName] has taught them to be almost self-reliant extending the rations they march with and thus making them much less reliant on the supply train to keep them fit for action."
 distinction.20.a:0 "Most impressive."
 distinction.21.t:0 "Cowardly Flight"
 distinction.21.desc:0 "The cowards of [actor.GetName] have fled the field, leaving supplies and stragglers for the enemy to take as they wish. The tides of this war might have been turned by this alone! This is a blemish on our honor, but even more so on theirs. They should have stood their ground until the end rather than coming back as cowards."

 distinction.25.desc:0 "Cutting the head off a snake is a good way to quickly dispatch the threat. after the cowardly actions of [dishonor_fallen_commander.GetName], they lacked the fortitude of mind and body to keep their leader alive.
