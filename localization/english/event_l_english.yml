With this [actor.GetName] has found the hidden advantages of the desert and made them part of their own arsenal of weapons, to be deployed against any enemy who would dare to enter their domain."
 distinction.4.a:0 "I almost feel sad for the enemy."
 distinction.5.t:0 "Barbarians Rebuffed"
 distinction.5.desc:0 "A triumphant victory was had against the barbaric hordes! [actor.GetName] has brought justice upon those who would intrude upon our lands and threaten the safety of our population. A victory such as this should bring them a wealth of slaves and glory, rewards that will feed their determination for further victories."
 distinction.5.a:0 "This has safeguarded our people."
 distinction.6.t:0 "Practice Makes Perfect"
 distinction.6.desc:1 "Experience is the teacher of all things. The [adiutrix_legion.GetName] has shown rare alacrity, throwing themselves into the arms of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_war_god')] with gusto. Their enthusiasm in practice and battles alike prove the key to success is to pass knowledge and experience on to the young instead of having them learning the hard way. Fighting side by side, with full trust in the man next to you, as an effective, cohesive combat unit, strikes fear into their foe's hearts."
 distinction.6.a:0 "The enemy will dread these men."
 distinction.7.t:0 "The First Legion"
 distinction.7.desc:1 "It is a large step for a nation to show it has the resources to keep a standing army. As we have formed [primagena_legion.GetName], we now stand as a nation above others! Our glorious nation enters a new era of professional soldiers that will show no mercy to our enemies. Additionally, they will be able to forge a legacy of their own, and bravery or lack thereof shall determine its character."
 distinction.7.a:0 "A new era has begun."
 distinction.8.t:0 "A Great Cavalry Victory"
 distinction.8.desc:0 "Today is a day of triumph as we have driven our enemy before us and heard the lamentation of those overrun. [actor.GetName] has brought glory to itself and our nation by upholding the high standards of cavalry set by the hetairoi of Alexander. The key to victory, today just as back then, was an exemplary use of hammer and anvil tactics, where the enemy was locked down by our own frontlines as the cavalry flanked and then slammed into their back, killing many and breaking the spirit of the rest."
 distinction.8.a:0 "One would not want to stand in front of their charge."
 distinction.9.t:0 "[actor.GetCommander.GetPraenomen]'s Great Victory"
 distinction.9.desc:0 "Our future magnificent leader, [actor.GetCommander.GetPraenomen], has brought a triumphant victory at the head of the [actor.GetName]. As told in the reports the victory was secured as the heir [actor.GetCommander.GetHerselfHimself] led a daring charge at the strong point of the enemy. Tales of this battle will be told for generations, and any man who has served will never have a dry cup. An event such as this will also be marked in the annals of history related to [actor.GetName], making it a mark of glory to get even to serve in it. "
 distinction.9.a:0 "[root.GetPrimaryHeir.GetPraenomen] has brought glory to us all."
 distinction.10.t:0 "Engineered Outcome"
 distinction.10.desc:0 "The enemy thought themselves safe behind their walls, but the experienced engineers of [legion_poliorcetes.GetName] have shown this was false - they were not an obstacle for long. No fortress is stronger than its weakest point, and a good engineer will find it and take advantage of it in no time. As the sappers dug underneath the walls, weakening them, the army at large kept the enemy in the dark with feigned attacks. Without the engineers we would have lost many more lives, and more importantly, time."
 distinction.10.a:0 "Nothing stands up to a sharp mind."
 distinction.11.t:0 "Sacking For The Gods"
 distinction.11.desc:0 "The gods look favorably upon [pious_legion.GetName], who have sacked the site of a god not worthy of being mentioned. The holy men and women tried their best to stop our soldiers, but against an army there was little they could do to resist. Had their god been as powerful as they claimed, they surely would have been able to put up some resistance to protect their holy site."
 distinction.11.a:0 "This surely will show our dedication to the ones above."
 distinction.12.t:0 "Barca"
 distinction.12.desc:0 "We have gotten word from [barca_legion.GetName], and it seems that they have done what some thought to be impossible. No sane commander would have taken an army at such a pace through such lands… or that is what conventional wisdom would have us think. Evidence however shows us that it has worked, despite the attached dangers, and the enemy was taken by surprise by this sudden appearance. As the commander said in his last message before the battle, “I will either find a way, or make one”. "
 distinction.12.a:0 "They surely have done the impossible."
 distinction.13.t:0 "Stalwart Victories"
 distinction.13.desc:0 "Many victories have been bestowed upon [actor.GetName] and it does not seem to stop. Glory and honor is being bestowed upon all soldiers within it, let us just hope we get some time to enjoy it before the next victory. And even victories come with losses in men, let us hope our victories will not leave us ruined."
 distinction.13.a:0 "There cannot be such a thing as winning too much?"
 distinction.14.t:0 "Tusked Mayhem"
 distinction.14.desc:0 "Our magnificent victory today by [actor.GetName] has shown what truly is supreme on the battlefield. Other nations squabble with phalanxes and horsebound infantry, but once the elephants charge the brave fall and the smart runs for their lives. With this victory at hand we are sure that [actor.GetName] will put even more focus into these noble beasts for our future war efforts."
 distinction.14.a:0 "Our armies are unstoppable."
 distinction.15.t:0 "Reflections of Glory"
 distinction.15.desc:0 "A remarkable victory has been achieved by [actor.GetName] after a crushing victory against the pompous Greeks and their phalanx. Had Alexander seen the sloppiness of their movement, weakness of the guards for the flanks and slow reactions to our tactics he would have wept. With this great victory we will take the glory of the silver shields for ourselves as we now have the most proficient heavy infantry in the world."
 distinction.15.a:0 "The days of the Greeks are numbered."
 distinction.16.t:0 "Saviors"
 distinction.16.desc:0 "We have been reached by news regarding [actor.GetName] and their actions in saving roman lives. They came to the rescue as our countrymen were under the immense pressure of the enemy keeping them in check.  As should be [actor.commander.GetPraenomen] was presented with the highest military decoration of the land as the survivors saved scoured the battlefield for grass, flowers and other plants to make him a crown of grass."
 distinction.16.a:0 "The highest honor one could have bestowed."
 distinction.17.t:0 "The Triumphant [triumph_legion.GetName]"
 distinction.17.desc:1 "It is a glorious day for [triumph_legion.GetName]; their many achievements on the field of battle have brought a triumph to their magnificent commander, [target.GetName].\n\nThough one might think it were all for the general, with their resplendent toga and divinely painted face, it is a rare honor for the men to march into the city alongside the spoils of victory - a permanent honor to their name and a chance to show their own glory, parading through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] with fresh uniforms and shining phaleras for all to see."
 distinction.17.a:0 "They will all be kings for a day."
 distinction.18.t:0 "Steadfast Victory"
 distinction.18.desc:0 "In a battle, being methodical and having a good plan will make what might otherwise look like an even match turn into a one sided matter. As shown in their latest victory, [actor.GetName] has shown that they might even be able to push the ocean itself back with their resolve. As the enemy came with all their might, trying to push into our lines, they were time after time rebuffed. With each attack, our shields held strong and the enemies fell to our blades as they were pushed into close quarters. Today’s glorious victory will live on and guide the way forward for this army!"
 distinction.18.a:0 "They are an example for us all."
 distinction.19.t:0 "Fulminous Victory"
 distinction.19.desc:0 "Many battles are won with strategy, others with bravery, and some by intervention from the heavens. As [actor.GetName] was fighting, things were looking grim as the enemy made steady gains without our men being able to push them back. As the wind picked up, the enemy’s resolve started to falter whereas we were certain that this was the gods lending us a hand. When the lightning struck the enemy army the battle was over, not a man among them brave enough to stand up to the will of the gods. With this, [actor.GetName] will now fly the thunderbolt as part of their legacy."
 distinction.19.a:0 "May we all be so lucky to have the gods on our side."
 distinction.20.t:0 "Logistical Marvel"
 distinction.20.desc:0 "An army walks on its stomach, this is something every competent commander is well aware of. Assigning designated foraging parties as part of the soldier's daily tasks has done wonders for how long the army's rations last. It seems that the commander of [actor.GetName] has taught them to be almost self-reliant extending the rations they march with and thus making them much less reliant on the supply train to keep them fit for action."
 distinction.20.a:0 "Most impressive."
 distinction.21.t:0 "Cowardly Flight"
 distinction.21.desc:0 "The cowards of [actor.GetName] have fled the field, leaving supplies and stragglers for the enemy to take as they wish. The tides of this war might have been turned by this alone! This is a blemish on our honor, but even more so on theirs. They should have stood their ground until the end rather than coming back as cowards."
 distinction.21.a:0 "All of them are cravens!"
 distinction.22.t:0 "Uncivilized Looting"
 distinction.22.desc:0 "It is natural to expect some reports of looting when a city is taken, but, from what we hear of [actor.GetName], they have taken it too far! They have acted with dishonor, looting everything they could get their hands upon and slaying countless civilians. Such greed and bloodlust is not becoming of an army of our country."
 distinction.22.a:0 "Do we have soldiers or a pack of bandits?"
 distinction.23.t:0 "Disgraced Legion"
 distinction.23.desc:1 "Some of our most professional forces have defected to the side of the rapscallion [mutineer_revolting_country.GetRuler.GetName]! If they are ever reconstitued after our victory, the stain on their reputation will be hard to remove."
 distinction.23.a:1 "Their dishonor will not be forgotten."
 distinction.24.t:0 "Impious Sacking"
 distinction.24.desc:0 "The fools of [pious_legion.GetName] might just have doomed us all, as they sacked a holy site of our gods! Let us all hope the wrath of the heavens will be contained to those guilty of the deed rather than bringing their fury upon us all. It will be a large undertaking full of risk for them to regain the favor of the gods."
 distinction.24.a:0 "These men has foolishly tempted the wrath of the gods."
 distinction.25.t:0 "Headless Snake"
 distinction.25.desc:0 "Cutting the head off a snake is a good way to quickly dispatch the threat. after the cowardly actions of [dishonor_fallen_commander.GetName], they lacked the fortitude of mind and body to keep their leader alive. This will be a tarnish on their name and something that will keep future commanders worried."
