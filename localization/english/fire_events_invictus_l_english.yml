 fire_events.2.desc:0 "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]#!, a fire has broken out in a bakery in #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#!. If we do not act soon, we may have to rebuild parts of the city. \n Some of our ministers assure us that rebuilding the city would be less expensive than sending the fire brigade. They say that a few slaves aren't worth our time. Others insist on helping the inhabitants of #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#!, arguing that it is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate our benevolence. Our subjects would be eternally grateful were we to rescue them."

 fire_events.3.desc:0 "The fire in #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#! has worsened and has encroached on the neighboring buildings. The mayor implores us to send help, before more devastating damage cripples the city for the foreseeable future. Already, some inhabitants have been burned alive, including a master craftsman. We can still prevent further destruction if we allocate enough fire fighters and resources immediately!"

 fire_events.4.desc:0 "The city of #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#! will soon be naught but ashes. Even the stone has melted; it is a ghastly spectacle. The fires burn, as if the Gods themselves were commanding them to immolate the city. The priests say, that the citizens of #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#! angered the Gods and are now being cleansed. My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], now we can only pray for them."
 fire_events.4.a:0 "May the Gods have Mercy on their Souls."
 
  #5. The fire ends

 fire_events.5.desc:0 "The fires in #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#! have died down and the remnants are being inspected. Only some rubble, ashes and slag remain of the once proud city. \n What should we do now? We could rebuild the city, which would benefit us in the long term, but would necessitate an investment. However, the priests say that the city was punished by the Gods themselves, and thus it would be blasphemy if we were to restore the city."
 fire_events.5.a:0 "The priests are driveling again."
 fire_events.5.b:0 "The Gods must have punished #Y [SCOPE.sProvince('en_fuego')GetName]#!."
