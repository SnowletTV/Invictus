gadir_inv.17.desc:0 "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], news from the borders just reached us. #¥ Carthaginian#! troops have raided some of our lands bordering their own. Our advisor have different recommendations as to what we should do next. One demands retaliation, a second wants to pour resources into preventing any similar incidents and a third thinks we can demand Carthage pay us back. Our last options would be to simply ignore this incident or to quitely build back up. These may not be the most popular however..." 
gadir_inv.17.a:0 "Retaliate."
gadir_inv.17.b:0 "Prevent any further incidents."

gadir_inv.18.desc:0 "Just now, messengers from Iberia have arrived. They hail from the rich port-city of #Y Gadir#!. Their accusations are grave however: they claim, that we raided their territories and now they demand recompensation. Such insolence from a small city on the edge of the world..."
gadir_inv.18.a:0 "Ignore theses claims."
gadir_inv.18.b:0 "It is but a paltry sum - and good relations never hurt."

gadir_inv.19.desc_1:0 "Our demands have been met and the damge repaid, but money cannot replace men. We are not yet ready to confront Carthage, so it will have to suffice. For now." 
gadir_inv.19.desc_2:0 "Curse these Carthaginian dogs. They will pay for the damage done one day! Our poor cities raided and their inhabitants killed. What did we do? \nCarthage, may you rot in Baal's name and may Melqart sink your ships!" 
gadir_inv.19.a:0 "Not all of them are rotten..."

The city of #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! is a strategic point on the other side of the Atlas mountains.

We should not forget that their prices differ according to the resources needed for their respective plans to succeed."

gadir_inv.21.desc_2:0 "The merchant we sent to #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! was successful. He managed to bribe enough officials and made us popular enough that they defected. The locals organised themselves and are now our loyal vassals." 
gadir_inv.21.desc_3:0 "The merchant we sent managed to convince some people to leave #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! and join us in our efforts agaonst #Y Carthage#!. Sadly he wasn't persuasive enough to take #Y [GetProvince('(int32)3080').GetName]#! over..."

gadir_inv.22.desc:0 "We got successful in our capture of Rusaddir.
