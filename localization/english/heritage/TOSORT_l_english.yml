 trapezan_heritage:0 "Trapezan Heritage"
 trapezan_heritage_desc:0 "A Sinopian colony founded around 756BCE by Milesian traders, Trapezous was a cultural melting pot, originally home to several Caucasian tribes, and was a trade gateway from the Pontos Euxinos into the Achaemenid Empire and the east at large. Fighting his way out of Anatolia, Xenophon recorded in his Anabasis that he and his 10,000 mercenaries got ''provisions in Trapezus by purchase, for the Trapezuntians provided us a market, and in return for the honors they bestowed upon us and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we paid them like honors; if any of the barbarians were their friends, we kept our hands off them, while upon their enemies, against whom they would themselves lead us, we wrought all the harm we could'' (5.5.14)."
 kerasous_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kerasous"
 kerasous_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly coming from the Greek: κερασός ''cherry'', Pliny the Elder writes that the first cherry was exported from this colony town to Europe in Roman times by means of Sulla's close friend Lucius Lucullus. Settled in the 6th century BCE by Sinopian colonists, this port town was also famously visited by Xenophon, as recorded in his Anabasis."
 kos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kos"
 kos_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the mythological autochthonous king Merops, Kos existed throughout ancient history as a place of wealth, learning, and luxury production. Freed from Persia's grip following the Greco-Persian Wars (later only shortly ruled by the Carian satrapy for a while), the island remained largely independent around the great Aegean leagues, Alexander's Empire, and the raging Diadochi, gaining a form of oligarchic self rule even while under the 'ownership' of the Ptolemies, who used it as a place for educating their dynasty. Kos also maintained a recognition for fine wine, a bevy of silk clothes, and the island's famous Asclepion."
 commagenian_heritage:0 "Commagenian Heritage"
 commagenian_heritage_desc:0 "The region of Commagene, while its pre-Hellenistic age history is blurry, appears to have a long and continuous footnote in history stretching all the way back to its time as a Syro-Hittite kingdom referred to in the 15th century BCE as ''Kummaha'', near identical with the later Archaic city of ''Kummuh'', thought to be the same site/city as Hellenistic Samosata, where the Attic poet Lucian supposedly came from. Existing possibly as a satrap of the Armenian Kingdom before being a province under the Seleucids, the area boasts a multicultural demographic, being a melting pot for Hellenic and Iranian cultures, best seen in the royal sanctuary on Mount Nemrut."
 bambyce_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Aramean Priest-Kings"
 bambyce_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the famous temple for its patron deity: Atargatis, Bambyce's history traces back to its annexation by the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BCE. Coinage suggests that it was ruled by Aramean priest-kings near the end of Achaemenid domination and transitioned to Seleucid monarchical governance following the collapse of Alexander's Empire. The city prospered under the yoke of Macedonian/Seleucid rule, becoming 'the place' to stop at between Antioch and Seleucia on the Tigris, eventually becoming the richest city in Roman Syria."
 olbe_cilicia_heritage:0 "Olban Heritage"
 olbe_cilicia_heritage_desc:0 "The only independent Cilician Kingdom, Olbe was supposedly founded by Ajax, son of Teucer. It became a pirate's haven after the ruling dynastic priests of Cilicia Tracheia fell to chaotic, short-lived tyrants and fell further into disarray after those. These Cilician pirates would later reappear in notable records during the Servile Wars, offering Spartacus a chance to cross from mainland Italy into Sicily before taking his money and leaving him and his army stranded."
 laranda_heritage:0 "Larandan Heritage"
 laranda_heritage_desc:0 "The greatest marauders from eastern Anatolia, the Lycaonians of Laranda lost much of their glory following the invasions of the Makedonian empire and the following infighting between the diadochi rulers - notably, Perdiccas destroyed the settlement in 322 BCE, after which habitation gradually resumed."
 kotyora_heritage:0 "Kotyoran Heritage"
 kotyora_heritage_desc:0 "A colony founded by Milesians from Sinope, this town was a resting point for Xenophon and his 10,000 mercenaries, who rested there for 45 days. Speaking to Sinopian diplomats about the native Kotyorites in his Anabasis, he writes: they did not behave toward us as friends, but shut their gates and would neither admit us within nor send a market without; and they alleged that the governor set over them by you was responsible for this conduct."
 amisos_heritage:0 "Amison Heritage"
 amisos_heritage_desc:0 "Established by Ionian Milesians between 760 and 750BCE, this town is notable for two things: the early wild goat style pottery found in archaeological excavations, and the fact that the area is, according to the Greek historian Hecataeus, the site of the previously known Enete - home of the Paphlagonian Enetoi whose king Plyaemenes was an ally of the Trojans in the fabled war."
 sinope_heritage:0 "Heritage of Autolycus"
 sinope_heritage_desc:0 "Namesake of the red earth pigment 'sinopia', the colony of Sinope traces its lineage to both Miletian colonists and the legendary Autolycus, grandfather of both Jason of the Argonauts and the wandering Odysseus. A colony itself, Sinope expanded to found its own colonies along the coast of the Pontos Euxinos, creating a hub of trade between the many Greek cities, outposts, and emporioi."
 paphlagonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pylaemenes"
 paphlagonia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the oldest tribes in Anatolia and established in myth as having been strong allies of the Trojan defenders in the 10-year war, the Paphlagonians were in those ancient times ruled by the king Pylaemenes - many of his successors have payed tribute to his revered reign and legacy by taking on his name as their own, wearing the title: ''Pylaemenes''. This tribe would soon spawn the line of Mithridates following the fall of Alexander's Empire, one of the staunchest thorns in the Roman Republic's side."
 kaukonia_heritage:0 "Kaukonian Heritage"
 kaukonia_heritage_desc:0 "It is hard to say where the Kaukones came from, or where they went. Some, like Homer, consider them an autochthonous group in Anatolia, while others consider the name to be referring to a Greek tribe, or a tribe having moved into Greece. For all intent and purposes, the Iliadic reference to Kaukones is used, and so they can say they were part of the great Trojan War - huzzah!"
 sesamos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Amastris"
 sesamos_heritage_desc:0 "While Sesamos was its own Ionian colony, as outlined in a reference in the Iliad, it was supposedly joined with other cities in order to create the grand city/territory of Amastris, named after the same Amastris who was the wife of Darius III of Persia, Dionysius of Heraclea, and Lysimachus. The site of Sesamos then became the center of and housed the acropolis of the new Amastris following the woman's separation from Lysimachus."
 tieion_heritage:0 "Heritage of Philetairos"
 tieion_heritage_desc:0 "The colony of Tieion, founded in the 7th century BCE, was the birthplace of Philetaerus and Pergamon's royal dynasty. A eunuch all his life (a crowd supposedly crushed his genitals), he served under Antigonos, Lysimachus, and Seleucus during the Diadochi Wars before finding independence in Pergamon and establishing the reign of the Attalid dynasty."
 mariandynia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mariandynus"
 mariandynia_heritage_desc:0 "A tribe sometimes described akin to the neighboring Bithyni, and sometimes described akin to the Paphlagonians, the Mariandyni have lived in forced servitude of several peoples, including those living in Heraclea Pontica. But all of these can trace their lineage back to Aeolian Mariandynus and his grandson of the same name - the composer of mourning songs."
 calchedon_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Blind"
 calchedon_heritage_desc:0 "A Megaran colony founded in 685BCE, its founders must have been cursed by the gods to be so blind as to not found their colony on the far superior other side of the Bosporus Straight (where Byzantion was built). Both Greeks (Athenians) and Persian Megabyzus said as much of them. Yet the city experienced a wealth of trade and built many temples to the gods. Blind luck."
 astakos_heritage:0 "Astakan Heritage"
 astakos_heritage_desc:0 "A Megaran colony established in the 8th century BCE, also supposedly founded by the legendary Astakos, son of Poseidon and the nymph Olbia, this city's greatest legacy would be in its destruction by the Bithynian king Zipoetes I in 301 BCE and the founding of a new city in its place: Nicomedia, future Eastern Roman capital under Diocletian, named after Nicomedes I, Zipoetes' son."
 kyzikos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kyzikenus"
 kyzikos_heritage_desc:0 "Known best for its kyzikenus (coin), the city's gold stater worth 28 drachma, Kyzikos was a prospering colony city following the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War and the decline of both Miletus and Athens. This city is also where the philosopher Eudoxus of Knidos established his school in the 4th century BCE."
 isauria_heritage:0 "Isaurian Heritage"
 isauria_heritage_desc:0 "Marauders and Raiders from the hills on the Arasus, these people were staunchly independent, surviving a siege by Perdiccas in 432 AVC by burning down their own capital of Isaura. The fierce mountain people would survive the Lydian, Achaemenid and Argead empires, earning the outside acknowledgement for being the fiercest raiders in Southwest Anatolia."
 kotennia_heritage:0 "Kotennian Heritage"
 kotennia_heritage_desc:0 "Kotennia was the last holdout of the Pamphylians cities against outside rule, and maintained a long and proud history including an Aboriginal/Greek cultural mix stemming from the Bronze Age. But as the Antigonid Kingdom still occupies their old homeland, they have not been able to do much. The Pamphylians are a maritime culture, a fact which they hold in contention with the Antigonid fleet frequently patrolling their traditional coastline."
 homonadia_heritage:0 "Homonadian Heritage"
 homonadia_heritage_desc:0 "Worst of the Pisidians, the Homonadiae were barbarous marauders, attacking anyone who so dared encroach on their lands. Their raiders seized many slaves from neighboring cities in the region, selling them to the Isaurians and Olbeans to bolster their markets."
 selgia_heritage:0 "Selgian Heritage"
 selgia_heritage_desc:0 "Recorded by different sources as having been founded by colonists from Laconia, Selge became the most powerful and populous city of Pisidia, in which Alexander the Great himself passed through on his way to Cilicia. The region around the city was exceptionally fertile and their trade would blossom all the way through the time of Hadrian."
 pednelissia_heritage:0 "Pednelissan Heritage"
 pednelissia_heritage_desc:0 "A smaller city near the border between the regions of Pisidia and Pamphylia, Pednelissia was always hard-pressed to compete with larger neighbors such as the populous Selge. In order to combat its immediate threats, it had a history of submitting to and calling on larger allies such as the diadochi."
 sagalassos_heritage:0 "Sagalassian Heritage"
 sagalassos_heritage_desc:0 "The oldest city in Pisidia, Sagalassos has maintained a key historical and geographical role since the time of the Hittites as a major center of the Arzawa. While they were the first city of Pisidia, they are no longer the most important one. In recent centuries Selge had overtaken them in power and population to the point where they were forced  to submit under the yoke of the Antigonids."
 lycia_heritage:0 "Lycian Heritage"
 lycia_heritage_desc:0 "A very old people, in ancient times known as the Lukka, the Lycians have almost always been united since the invasion of Cyrus the Great, having become an Achaemenid client kingdom. They joined the Delian League after Plataea, holding onto their independence for 40 years, after which they became clients again. Lycia managed to survive Alexander's invasion without a significant effect on the people, yet their league found itself submitting as an Antigonid vassal following the breakout of the diadochi wars."
 solymia_heritage:0 "Solymian Heritage"
 solymia_heritage_desc:0 "With its fame stretching back as far as the Iliad, it was recently one of the few cities Alexander was unable to conquer during his war against the Persians. Termessos was a fortress city in a key pass to Pamphylia, both heavily fortified and easy to manage. Supposedly founded by the legendary Solymi people of Lycia, the city's people have taken the same name for themselves, carrying on the legendary legacy."
 arykandia_heritage:0 "Arykandian Heritage"
 arykandia_heritage_desc:0 "Arykandia, as one of the oldest Lycian cities. While it avoided joining any leagues, it boasted a cosmopolitan demographic and a degree of tolerance with many temples dedicated to various deities within the Hellenic, Zoroastrian, and native Anatolian faiths."
 oinoandia_heritage:0 "Oinoandian Heritage"
 oinoandia_heritage_desc:0 "A colony of Termessos in Milyas, Oenoanda would later unite with Kibyratia and create the Kibyran Tetrapolis, which would last for a hundred years, joining with the Lycian league in 669 AVC"
 kibyra_heritage:0 "Kibyran Heritage"
 kibyra_heritage_desc:0 "The most powerful city in Milyas, Kibyratia grew into a sprawling zone of political control, at one time extending from the Rhodian Peraea all the way to Pisidia. The city would later absorb its close neighbors and establish the Kybiran Tetrapolis, becoming a threat even to the Lycian League and Rhodes."
 arados_heritage:0 "Heritage of Arados"
 arados_heritage_desc:0 "Hegemon of northern Phoenicia, Arados, Phoenician ''Arwad'', was a fortified trade island off the coast of provincial Syria which had been noted for its importance both in trade and in naval prowess since the time of the old Egyptian pharaohs. Founded sometime in the early 2nd millennium, Arados was also attested as one of the first republics in the Levant."
 sidon_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sidon"
 sidon_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly the oldest of all the Phoenician cities, Sidon found itself caught up in the history of countless empires ranging from the ancient Egyptian pharaohs to Alexander the Great. As it sailed these dangerous political waters, it continued to produce countless luxury goods for sale to the whole Mediterranean and even sent its own people on a mission to found Tyre - its both its greatest achievement and also its greatest competition in the years to come."
 andros_heritage:0 "Heritage of Andros"
 andros_heritage_desc:0 "A key naval connector between the Cycladic archipelago and the Helladic mainland, Andros' history stretches back to the Bronze Age with the site of Palaeopolis. This ancient capital exhibited one of the earliest examples of fortifications in all of Greece. The Archaic/Classical Era replacement atop this old settlement, the city of Andros, became a wealthy and sprawling place, powerful enough to rebuke Athenian domination and to send out its own colonists to the region of Chalkidiki."
 nesiotic_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Nesiotic League"
 nesiotic_heritage_desc:0 "The brainchild of Antigonus I, the Nesiotic League was a strange and short-lived organization of islands forced to work together by dominating Makedonian powers - the diadochi. The league was most notably held under control by the Antigonids before being taken by the Ptolemies, and later disbanding and reforming under the jurisdiction of Rhodes. While it served a diadochi master, the League held annual ritual festival games, the Antigoneia (later the Soteria Ptolemaia) at the holy island of Delos in honor of their overlord."
 colchis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Aëetes"
 colchis_heritage_desc:0 "This land was known first as the realm of king Aeetes, home of the witch Medea, and the resting place of the Golden Fleece, home to riches and countless wealth as well which Jason and his argonauts all saw on their voyage to the Colchian shores. But some truth lies in this, as Colchis was a rapidly developing Caucasian culture, mastering metal casting by the late Bronze Age and developing into the recognizable kingdom by the 13th century BCE. However, Assyrian and Persian invasion and intervention led to the kingdom's decline, the recession of its borders and, at times, a total collapse of the governmental structures. By the time of the diadochi, Colchis had thrown off foreign rule and was again maintained by its native dynasty."
 phasis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Phasis"
 phasis_heritage_desc:0 "A Milesian colony founded in the Archaic period at the mouth of the river of the same name, Phasis was nestled inside the crook of the Colchian kingdom, bordered on all sides by the native 'barbarians'. However, the city seems to have got on peacefully enough with its neighbors and acted as a valuable trading port, or emporion, at the end of the loose trade network from India to the Pontos Euxinos."
 legia_heritage:0 "Legian Heritage"
 legia_heritage_desc:0 "Little is known about the ancient Lezgi-speaking tribes from around the Caucasus mountains except that they were beset by enemy attacks at all times on all fronts, living in a most favorable and geographically important location for the purposes of trade and military affairs. And so, they developed a livelihood surrounded by war, fueled by it, born to it."
 henioch_heritage:0 "Heniochian Heritage"
 henioch_heritage_desc:0 "The people of this tribe and country are at least as old as the 8th century BCE, with references to them coming from tablets found in the kingdom of Urartu. Little more is recorded about them, then that they are ''ready enough to kill and eat men'' - Aristotle."

 caucasia_albania_heritage:0 "Albanian Heritage"
 caucasia_albania_heritage_desc:0 "The Caucasian tribes, including the Caspian peoples, have largely been at odds with the rest of the world, isolated by their largely mountainous homeland. The kingdom of Albania in the Caucasus has no attested foundation date, but based on historical references is considered to have been a border community between the Iranian communities of the Median/Achaemenid Empire and the nomads living beyond in the steppe. The tribe of the Caspians and others within the kingdom of Albania were considered part of a satrapy of the Achaemenids and were involved in the Persian Empire's politics until it became an independent polity in the Hellenistic Age."

 fezzani_heritage_desc:0 "The tribes of the Fezzan were masters of desert combat and tamers of the numerous oases of Libya.

 garamantes_heritage:0 "Garamantean Heritage"
 garamantes_heritage_desc:0 "The Garamantes were the premier Saharan power in ancient times. Their desert-adapted armies proved deadly to other tribes and prevented the Romans from turning Fezzan into a province. The Garamantes also were prolific farmers and traders, mining precious gems from the Saharan mountain ranges, and facilitated long distance trade from Chad and Mali to the Mediterranean. The Garamantean conquest of the Saharan to modern Mali and Mauretania ensured that they were feared by all."
 macrobian_heritage:0 "Somali Heritage"
 macrobian_heritage_desc:0 "What the peoples of modern Somalia lacked in land warfare they made up for tremendously at sea. They were prolific traders of exotic goods, pirates and coastal raiders, taking advantage of those with inferior seamanship. Their trade network extended from India to the Mediterranean, and down the eastern coast of Africa, giving them diplomatic contacts across the known world."

 mosylon_heritage_desc:0 "The peoples of the great trade city of Mosylon were the masters of the sea. While their land was not abundant in agriculture, they lived off of the resources of the sea and trade with foreign empires as far as India and Rome.

 #Maldives Heritage
 Mahiladvipikan_heritage:0 "Mahiladvipikan Heritage"
 Mahiladvipikan_heritage_desc:0 "A large collection of natural atolls and islets, the archipelago surrounding the legendary island of Mahiladvipika was the home of rather-isolated populations, originally comprised of a mix of Southwestern Indian and Northwestern Sri Lankan peoples, but later influenced by the supposed arrival of the Sinhalese people in the 6th century BCE as Magadha exiles. The island chain sits at an important waypoint straddling the Indian-Red Sea route, and contributed to the general Erythraean Sea connectivity. Buddhism would soon take grip of several of the atolls, inspiring cultural renovation and innovation in order to create a Maldive identity."

 shunga_heritage_desc:0 "The mighty House of Shunga seized power when its founder, the great general Pushyamitra, betrayed and slew his lord, the last Raja of Maurya. The Shunga Coup, as it came to be known, would prove a calamity far too great for the weakening Maurya to bear; its empire would crumble, with its prized core lands passing on to the dominion of the Shunga. And so shall it be with any that stand before them."
