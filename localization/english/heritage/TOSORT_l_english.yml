 fezzani_heritage_desc:0 "The tribes of the Fezzan were masters of desert combat and tamers of the numerous oases of Libya. While they struggle against properly trained legions in open field, their desert guerilla fighting and use of more mobile units presented an everlasting challenge to Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans alike."

 macrobian_heritage_desc:0 "What the peoples of modern Somalia lacked in land warfare they made up for tremendously at sea. They were prolific traders of exotic goods, pirates and coastal raiders, taking advantage of those with inferior seamanship. Their trade network extended from India to the Mediterranean, and down the eastern coast of Africa, giving them diplomatic contacts across the known world."

 Mahiladvipikan_heritage_desc:0 "A large collection of natural atolls and islets, the archipelago surrounding the legendary island of Mahiladvipika was the home of rather-isolated populations, originally comprised of a mix of Southwestern Indian and Northwestern Sri Lankan peoples, but later influenced by the supposed arrival of the Sinhalese people in the 6th century BCE as Magadha exiles. The island chain sits at an important waypoint straddling the Indian-Red Sea route, and contributed to the general Erythraean Sea connectivity. Buddhism would soon take grip of several of the atolls, inspiring cultural renovation and innovation in order to create a Maldive identity."
