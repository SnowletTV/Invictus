The Achaemenid Persian Empire had been sending Greek (mostly Ionian) exiles from their westernmost provinces to this northeastern border as a means of preventing further revolts, especially after the famed Ionian revolt which acted as prelude to the 1st Greco-Persian War. These Greeks were sent to a city known as Cyropolis on the lower bank of the Jaxartes, so named after the founder of the Achaemenid dynasty, which Alexander likely renamed to his furthest city upon his conquest of all of Persia. This place had become, especially with the extra Greeks settled by Alexander, a bastion of Hellenism in the area, in which the people would live off the fertile land, raise their famous “Heavenly Horses,” and would be integrated into the greater Greco-Bactrian society until invaders from the East came knocking."

These people were both warriors and merchants, making the beginnings of the Silk Road through trading hubs such as what would become the well-known Samarkand. And before becoming embroiled in the Wars of the Diadochi, the last great moment in their land was the battle at the Sogdian Rock, a fortress marvel beheld by all the Greeks of the army of Alexander."

 olbe_cilicia_heritage_desc:0 "The only independent Cilician Kingdom, Olbe was supposedly founded by Ajax, son of Teucer. It became a pirate's haven after the ruling dynastic priests of Cilicia Tracheia fell to chaotic, short-lived tyrants and fell further into disarray after those. These Cilician pirates would later reappear in notable records during the Servile Wars, offering Spartacus a chance to cross from mainland Italy into Sicily before taking his money and leaving him and his army stranded."

But some truth lies in this, as Colchis was a rapidly developing Caucasian culture, mastering metal casting by the late Bronze Age and developing into the recognizable kingdom by the 13th century BCE. However, Assyrian and Persian invasion and intervention led to the kingdom's decline, the recession of its borders and, at times, a total collapse of the governmental structures.

 ###Kaounos
 Kaunos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kaunos"
 Kaunos_heritage_desc:0 "While the material remains of Kaunos date its foundation or early site-use to at most the 9th century BCE, the traditional history of the city dates back to the namesake king Kaunos, son of King Miletus, founder of that city. It is said that Kaunos and his sister, Byblis, fell in love and that, in order to avoid incest, Kaunos fled her company all the way to Lycia in Anatolia. Here, Byblis followed him but fell into sorrow and madness and died, turning into a spring, crying her incessant tears over the land and creating with her watery eyes the river the Calbys river. In Asia, Kaunos married the nymph Pronoe and had a son, Aegialus, who founded a city nearby, named for his father. The city itself was an excellent trade harbor, having two functioning ports, and Herodotus notes that the people of the city resiliently fought against the Persian general Harpagus - they did, after a while, lose. The historian also notes that while he personally disagrees with their claim of their own foreign origin, because they speak a language similar to that of his own home, he cannot deny that they act in a peculiar manner, different from all the other Carians and Lycians. All the men, women, and even the children drink wine together."
 ###Physkos
 Physkos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Leto's Castle"
 Physkos_heritage_desc:0 "A trading port town, Physkos was known for two things. The first was that, high up, there was a great castle which Herodotus claims had been there since 3,000 BCE. Alexander the Great sieged this castle and the town itself, and when the inhabitants had fled, being unable to defend their number of 600 against him, he made a point of repairing and maintaining the tactical, imposing structure. It is also known that the town served as a worship site for Leto, mother goddess to the twins Apollo and Artemis. While many have claimed there is a sacred grove dedicated to her (which there may be), there is a well known cave hidden on a small island connected to the area around Physkos by a narrow isthmus. In this cave, Leto was indeed worshiped during the Greek period, but the remains there reveal site-use tracing back almost 12,000 years (10,000 BCE)."

It is said that the Libyan god Anti stood on top of the peaks as he challenged passers-bye and fought even Herakles. Perhaps they have inherited his titanic strength."
 ###Mauretania
 Mauretanian_heritage:0 "Mauretanian Heritage"
 Mauretanian_heritage_desc:0 "The kingdom of the Mauri, Mauretania, later coming to refer to the region touching the the sea beyond the Pillars of Herakles (Mauretania Tingitana), but also the region next to it (Mauretania Caesariensis), was a confederation of hill-based tribes brought together under the power of a few ruling ‘familiae’. The Mauri were a blessing and a curse to the colonial powers in the Libyan and European continents, trading rich goods from the mountainous interior lands with outsiders while also raiding their settlements on occasion, even crossing the sea itself to raid the Iberian region of Baetica."
 ###Nectiberia
 Nectiberian_heritage:0 "Nectiberean Heritage"
 Nectiberian_heritage_desc:0 "Settled at the foot of the Atlas mountain range, the Nectiberi can be found stuck between a rock and a hard place, literally, with two significant competitors in the notorious Autololes to their west and the raid-happy Mauri to their north. Their only means of escape, should an invasion or aggressive migration occur, would be through the mountains themselves. Luckily, they have the Pyrrhon Plain at their side, so sustenance is not one of their many problems."
 ###Autolalia
 Autolalian_heritage:0 "Autolalian Heritage"
 Autolalian_heritage_desc:0 "Strabo describes them as “the most powerful of the Libyan nations” while Pliny the Elder fears their ferocious nature. If it is to be believed that they once had Iarbas as their king, then Dido/Elissa and great Carthage too once feared their tribe because Iarbas was so aggressive a suitor of the Punic queen. While a Gaetulian tribe, the Autololes were more well known for their ravenous behavior, having fed on the flesh of terrible wild beasts."
 ###Daphnitaea

 Daphnitaean_heritage_desc:0 "Spread farther away from the feet of mountains and too far from the shore, the Daphnitae are confined to the vast horizon of endless desert which expands seemingly forever in all directions. Perhaps one of them may see a lone camel passing by, a lost Garamantine warrior from ages past, riding by on an old chariot, or they might see any sort of torturous vision appear amidst the hot haze of the homogenous sands. So is the life of those living among the dunes, traveling from watering hole to watering hole."

 Capariensian_heritage_desc:0 "Confined to the hills which serve as tactical positions in case of ambush or invasion, the Capariensi must be a wary and overly cautious people in order to survive, their backs against the last visible rocks before the endless desert.

 Lixitan_heritage_desc:0 "The only friendly and helpful natives which Hanno the Navigator found useful enough to take aboard his ship as translators for the remainder of his journey, the Lixitae were a unique tribe among many - much more favorable than their vicious Atutololian neighbors.

 ###Canaria
 Canarian_heritage:0 "Canarian Heritage"
 Canarian_heritage_desc:0 "These people, the Canarii, are named so because they are known to share their meals with dogs and spread the entrails of their prey, wild beasts, on a common plate.

This forest home can be found surrounded by a black desert, peppered with dark, rocky sand coming from below the ground."
 ###Massaesylia
 Massaesylian_heritage:0 "Massaesylian Heritage"
 Massaesylian_heritage_desc:0 "Bordering the Mauri in the west and controlling the western confederation of Numidian tribes, the Massaesylii were able to consolidate cultural and political control over many individual 'familiae' in response to the pressure of Mediterranean powers such as Carthage, as well as the consolidation and recognition of other segmented groups such as the Massylii in the east with whom they were antagonistic in their attempts to bring together all the Numidian tribes under one ruler. Still, they were fierce on the battlefield with their famous Numidian cavalry, as were their adjacent rivals."
 ###Massylia
 Massylian_heritage:0 "Massylian Heritage"
 Massylian_heritage_desc:0 "Most likely beginning as a few 'familiae', the Massylii took over political and cultural control of many Numidian tribes during the process of becoming a protectorate state of Carthage, held together by the recognition of a great power and the intricacies of tribal segmentation and consolidation. Like all Numidian tribes, the Massylii were known for their tactics with the swift and powerful Numidian horses and cavalry divisions, which they used to serve both Carthage and other powers, and also to wage war on their Massaesyli counterparts. Their subjugation is ironic and insulting, considering how Carthage once paid tribute to Numidian kings."

 Heritage_of_the_Great_Invading_Asparagus_desc:0 "The Gaetuli are often an indiscernible people, ranging across a vast landscape and having many sub tribes which can only be called “Gaetuli”. Yet the main body of the Gaetulian tribes, on the border with and often mixing both biologically and culturally with the related Numidian tribes, has been notable for quite a few things. These include invading everyone around them, indiscriminately, trading their exotic and dangerous wildlife, such as the Gaetulian lion, off to Mediterranean powers for sport, and growing asparagus of a size greater than two men and thick as the reeds found in the marshes of Cyprus. So it has been that these people are a great threat to their neighbors, and a constant source of amazement."

It is said that there were many bees around the lake, and that the Gyzantes made good use of them, extracting immeasurable amounts of honey. It is also said that they painted themselves red and ate the flesh of monkeys which could be found, innumerable, among the hills. Perhaps these men and women even rode the elephants living there, frequenting the shore of the great lake, its tributary river, or the many spacious watering holes."

 Heritage_of_the_Leather_Legged_Women_desc:0 "The Gindanes are notable for living near the sea, having once occupied the isle of Meninx long before the Lotus-Eaters, the Lotophagi, came to live in that place and eat of the lotus fruit which intoxicates the mind and turns away any person from life outside the shade of the lotus tree. Herodotus reports that the women within the Gindanes tribe would show how greatly they had been loved by the men with the addition of a leather anklet after a night spent with each new man. In this way, all the people knew which woman had been loved by the most men."
 ###Phazania
 Pheasant_heritage:0 "Pheasant Heritage"
 Pheasant_heritage_desc:0 "Building their civilization around the oasis town of Ghadames, the pearl of the desert, the Phazanii tribe (possibly meaning ‘country of the pheasants’) straddled the realms of Carthaginian influence and the greater desert beyond, to the south and the east. The Phasanii gave their name to the region known as the Fezzan, which no ancient power could subdue."
 ###Makae

 Heritage_of_the_Ostrich_Shield_desc:0 "Herodotus reports that these people “by letting the locks about the crown of their head grow long, while they clip them close everywhere else, make their hair resemble a crest” (Histories Book 4). It is likely that, because they are known for their ostrich shields, that they worked ostrich skin over a wooden base and were, to a man, as unique as their ostrich. These people live below the notable “Hill of the Graces,” which bears a thick forest and is greener than all the barren wastes of Libya."
 ###Machylia
 Androgynous_heritage:0 "Androgynous Heritage"
 Androgynous_heritage_desc:0 "A subtribe of the Macae, breaking off on their own at a time unknown, the Machlyes were a unique people who lie largely within myth and rumor. It is said that when they are even children they try their hand at basic warfare, fighting each other and their neighbors with sticks and stones. It is also said that they maintain halves of both man and woman, having on their body the breast of both a man and a woman, one to a side."
 ###Psyllia
 Snake_Bite_heritage:0 "Snake Bite Heritage"
 Snake_Bite_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that these ancient peoples test the strength and worthiness of their children with the venom of the snake, as they also do their wives for the purpose of bearing these strong children. Their origin is unknown, though it is known that they are old - oh so old - and have been cast adrift on the arid deserts by either high gales of searing wind or the strength of the nomadic Nasamones. They remain, to all outsiders, known as snake charmers, possessors of the most exotic means of both healing and poisoning."
 ###Nasamonia
 Nasamonian_heritage:0 "Nasamonian Heritage"
 Nasamonian_heritage_desc:0 "A nomadic Numidian tribe traveling along the eastern deserts, stopping at the rich Augila and Siwa oases where the only life in the area grows far to the south of lush Cyrenaica (there they pick dates and pour crushed locust remains over milk), the Nasamones were a fierce tribe who once lived near the coastline of the Mediterranean but were forced out of the area by the many Greek colonists such as those Therans who founded Cyrene. Noted for supposedly defeating the snake charmer Psylli in war, the Nasamones were never truly subject to anyone, and would be great obstacles for any future conquerors in the region."
 ###Cetiania
 Cetianian_heritage:0 "Cetianian Heritage"
 Cetianian_heritage_desc:0 "The Cetiani live by and control the upper Mulucha (modern Moulouya) river, which comes from the Greek meaning “a marsh mallow” -  yum. With the safety of the Atlas mountain range at their back and the precious and often exotic goods found in that area, the Cetiani have quite the assortment of things to send downstream in order to trade with the riverside Phoneician/Punic settlement of Bouhout and coastal Rusaddir."

####Thamusida
 Thamusidan_heritage:0 "Thamusidan Heritage"
 Thamusidan_heritage_desc:0 "Originally a Mauretanian Berber settlement, Thamusida, likely meaning “swampland” in the native language, became occupied, at least partially, by Phoenician settlers and traders in the sixth century BCE. The town, which lies on the Sububa river, was part of a trade network along the river with the inland settlement of Banasa and was also part of the expansive trade routes connecting north to Tingis at the Pillars of Herakles."
 ###Lixus
 Lixan_heritage:0 "Lixan Heritage"
 Lixan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by the Phoenicians sometime in the eighth century BCE, Lixus was a multicultural hub with a strong native Mauretanian population living in close-knit neighborhood structures alongside the Phoenician colonists and traders. By the Hellenistic period, the city notably relied a great deal on its export of fish in order to support its economy."
 ###Kuass
 Kuassan_heritage:0 "Kuassan Heritage"
 Kuassan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Phoenicians at least as early as the seventh century BCE, Kuass, possibly coming from the Libyan 'Akwass', was notable for its wealth of salt pools and production factories. This colony acted as a secondary site to the main production houses at Gadir for a notable set of red-slip tableware produced in the forms of common items such as amphorae."
 ###Rusaddir
 Rusaddiran_heritage:0 "Rusaddiran Heritage"
 Rusaddiran_heritage_desc:0 "Rusaddir, “The mighty cape,” was an important sight for any Phoneician or Punic sailor on their way to the Iberian peninsula. The city had a naturally-made and well-defended harbor on account of the rocks forming the cape which it draws its name from. It was the easternmost of the colony system connecting to the Pillars of Herakles and within the influence of Iberian Gadir."
 ###Iol
 Iolan_heritage:0 "Iolan Heritage"
 Iolan_heritage_desc:0 "Established sometime either in the sixth or fifth century BCE, Iol, or the “Sandy Island,” was an islet port which became one of the most important Punic centers in the region, minting the first coins in Numidia. It was notably fortified by the third century and the images on its coins depicted the fish it would sell abroad."
 ###Ibasim
 Ibasim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Abandoned"
 Ibasim_heritage_desc:0 "The islands of Ibiza/Evissa and Formentera, Phoenician Yboshim and Roman Frumenteria, labeled as their own island chain by the Greeks. The Pityusae, or “rich in pines,” were a uniquely scarcely inhabited area when the Phoenician settlers and traders arrived as back-migrants in the eighth century BCE from other colonies on the coast of Iberia. These islands, unlike the the talayotic-culture-inhabited Balearic islands of Majorca and Menorca to the east, experienced a vanishing of their population or perhaps a mass-abandonment after the Bronze Age collapse up until Phoenician occupation. The Phoenicians settled over barely populated previous settlements, first establishing an outpost at a southern cove on Ibiza before building their main port at the site of Yboshim, the namesake city for the island. The Pityusae were important ports for any ships traveling the northern route of the Mediterranean Sea to and from the Iberian coast."
 ###Utica
 Utica_heritage:0 "Heritage of the First Colonizers"
 Utica_heritage_desc:0 "The first Phoenician colony in the western Mediterranean, founded near the end of the ninth century BCE, Utica was set up at a strong geo-economic position at the mouth of the Bagradas river and imported goods from all over the Phoenician sphere of influence, including Levantine-Phoenician, Nuragic, Greek, Tartessian, Villanovan (early Etruscan), and Libyan wares at its expansive port and also saw a great deal of trade run through its connected port town of Rush 'Eshmun “Cape Eshmun” when the Bagrada changed its natural course and the original river path silted over, locking Utica into an inland position. Utica maintained complete autonomy until around 540 BCE, when it came into political arrangements as a powerful ally of Carthage, though it still competed with the new Punic capital economically."
 ###Kerkouane
 Kerkouanan_heritage:0 "Kerkouanan Heritage"
 Kerkouanan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the first half of the sixth century BCE, Kerkouane largely produced dyes and garum, owing to the size of its fishing production centers, its commercial centers, and the salt mines. The city acted as a large and prosperous trade center, made more effective by its regularized city-planning grid structure. The main necropolis for the city contains burials with votive goods ranging from foreign locations as far as Egypt."
 ###Hadrametum
 Hadrametan_heritage:0 "Hadrametan Heritage"
 Hadrametan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Tyrian settlers in the very late ninth century BCE, Hadrametum, its original name most likely meaning “south” or “southern place,” was more of a civil center of Phoenician occupation rather than a commercial center such as the many trade ports lining the north African coast which retained smaller populations but emphasized the exporting of luxury and exotic resources from interior trading and mining. This was accompanied by its well laid out building planning and the incorporation of a tophet for socio-religious use, as was characteristic in the major urban centers of colonial Phoenicia. In 310 BCE, Hadrametum was briefly captured by Agathocles of Syracuse near the end of the 7th Sicilian War, but was released when the Sicilians could not effectively keep the warfront in Africa after a long campaign of attrition and returned to Sicily where peace arrangements were soon drawn up."
 ###Leptis Minor
 Leptis_Minor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Leptis Minor"
 Leptis_Minor_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Tyrian merchants, Leptis Minor (Roman Leptis Parva), not to be confused with Leptis Magna (greater Leptis) farther south, possibly meant “construction” or “naval station” in the original Phoenician, inscribed LPQ and sometimes LPQY in the semitic triliteral root system abbreviation. While it came under the socio-political domination of Carthage like the rest of most of North Africa, Leptis Minor maintained its wealthy status and in later periods was noted for paying a daily tribute of 1 Attic Talent, almost 60 pounds of pure silver."
 ###Thapsus
 Thapsan_heritage:0 "Thapsan Heritage"
 Thapsan_heritage_desc:0 "Bearing in its name the native Libyan prefix 'tha-' but a typical Phoenician/Punic ending, the settlement maye have been a native site later taken over by the Phoenicians as had happened at multiple towns across much of Africa. Set upon a defensible promontory near a wealth of salt flats for mining, Thapsus was set up as a commercial center and a waystation for merchant ships en-route to the Iberian and Atlantic coasts."
 ###Achola
 Acholan_heritage:0 "Acholan Heritage"
 Acholan_heritage_desc:0 "A colony founded by Carthaginians from Melite, Achola/Acholla was built on the northern coast of the Lesser Syrtis bay and retained several unique aspects of native Miletan culture, such as inhumation burials, as opposed to the typical Punic tradition of cremation burials. The nearby island of Cercinna served as a strong look-out post for naval activity in the bay and hosted small settlements of native and Phoenician types. Perhaps these people took advantage of the octopus hunting grounds surrounding the Cercinna archipelago."
 ###Emporia
 Emporia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kohanim and the Lotus Eaters"
 Emporia_heritage_desc:0 "Likely coming from the Greek ‘emporion’ or trading post, the region of Emporia, while not quite clear in the ancient sources, seems to have encompassed several rich Phoenician/Punic trading outposts and merchant cities. The area was also quite fertile, supplied by the Lesser Syrtis and its connected rivers, and the nearby lake Tritonis. Ancient Takapes, a native Libyan name possibly alluding to the site's pre-Phoenician origin, was noted for its local springs which provided for many farmers and cultivators. But there was a more alluring nature to Emporia. It is said that the island of Meninx, not far offshore from the town of Gergis, was the spot at which Odysseus landed during his famous voyage, and that it was once lived upon solely by the native Gindanes, who ate the lotus which deprives men of all ambition but the consumption of the flower. Even stranger, there also exists a legend on the island among the small Jewish community that, when Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the temple of Solomon, many in the Kohanim priestly-cast of society in flew the holy city for the shores of Meninx and brought with them the door to the temple itself and several foundation stones. However, many claims are laid regarding the island and, too, all of Libya."
 ###Tripolitania
 Tripolitanian_heritage:0 "Tripolitanian Heritage"
 Tripolitanian_heritage_desc:0 "Tripolitania was a region known for three cities, Sabratha, Leptis Magna, and Oyat (Greek Oea). Established during the archaic period and most likely over the foundations of native Libyan villages set in prosperous geographical positions, these cities sat at the periphery of Carthaginian control of eastern North Africa, and any hold of a people over the area was tenuous when considering not only the powerful cultures along the Nile and in Cyrenaica, but also the many nomadic tribes, including the well-feared Garamantes, which were equally capable of both raiding and trading. This tenuous hold was proven when the Greek rulers from Cyrenaica took hold of Oyat the original Phoenician colonists and referred to it as the Greek Oea before the Carthaginians retook it and incorporated it into their sphere of control."
 ###Arambys
 arambys_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Purple Fortress"
 arambys_heritage_desc:0 "While Hanno the Navigator was supposedly the first to bring Punic people to these shores in the 5th century BCE, it is clear that the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The island which is known as Mogador provides the continental coast with a stiff protection from violent marine winds, creating the circumstances for a peaceful and safe harbor - this is why it served the Phoenicians best as a trading port, where their wares and storage devices have since been found. As a bulwark against the whims of the dangerous open sea and its raging gales, the native peoples knew the island as ''the small fortress''. The site, however, was not only rich in safety, but in resources. Many murex and purpura shells, from which that Tyrian purple dye can be extracted from, were found and used there for exporting the royal color."
 ###Aggadir
 aggadir_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Edge of Exploration"
 aggadir_heritage_desc:0 "Settled in the Archaic era like many of the early Phoenician trading ports in North Africa, Aggadir (alternatively known equally as Gadir and Agadir) may seem to some to have been at the edge of the world - the known world that is. Neighboring the Lixitae tribe who gave Hanno the Navigator his translator, the port of Aggadir was responsible for receiving and sending traders further down the mysterious African coast, waiting for the natives to lay goods along the beaches and trade these for a bargain price. Their profits would sail north, past Arambys and into the wealthy Circle of Gadir, crossing the twin pillars of Melqart before dispersing into the greater Mediterranean. The most confusing and unknown things could come up into this port-colony. Everything was foreign - everything was interesting. It filled the dreams of explorers."

## East African Heritages
 ###Dodekaschoinos
 Dodekaschoinos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Religious Peace"
 Dodekaschoinos_heritage_desc:0 "A frontier state created between the Ptolemies and Kushites which acted as a cultural and political buffer between a Greek Egypt and the Nubian (Meroe) sphere, the Dodekaschoinos, or the 12 cities, was meant to help integrate and regulate relations with the upper Egyptian and Nubian populations which did not appreciate the existence of foreign interference. The ancient temples built in the area, especially the one at Philae, dedicated to Isis, were the main focus for the garrison regent’s activities and, upon its conquest, several of the Ptolemies began a tradition of giving all the income of the 12 cities to the temples of both Egyptian and Nubian gods such as that of Mandulis. When the people were pacified, their societal needs met by the appeasement of their gods, this buffer state allowed for continuous long-distance trade along the Nile with the Nubian world, which would result in many exotic goods and war elephants find their way up through the 12 cities and into Ptolemaic Egypt itself where they would assist in the war efforts against the other Diadochi."
 ###Blemmia
 Blemmian_heritage:0 "Blemmian Heritage"
 Blemmian_heritage_desc:0 "It is known from writings that the Blemmyes existed at least as early as the Nubian king Anlamani in the 7th century BCE, but they are likely far older, having been continuous inhabitants of the desert-laden region east of the Nile and on the coast of the Red Sea. Influenced by a mixture of Egyptian and Meroitic cultures, the Blemmyes, at a time, worshiped well-known gods like Isis at Philae as well as southern divinities like Mandulis at Kalabsha. While outsiders have often referred to the Blemmyes as nomadic raiders, they controlled wealthy gold mines and mineral-rich regions and built many well-fortified and prosperous cities which may have housed a royal king or two."
 ###Alut
 Alut_heritage:0 "Alutan Heritage"
 Alut_heritage_desc:0 "Beginning at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, Alut has the benefit of Nile trade networks, the floodplains bringing a richness to the landscape, and the wealth of the mineral and metal deposits in the east which serve to be exported to Northern aristocracies such as the Kushites or the Macedonians in Ptolemaic Egypt. Possibly taking up the area as early as the 4th century BCE, the people of Alut came into regular conflict with the declining Kushite kingdom, as the land was desirable to all interested parties."
 ###Syrbotia
 Moyan_heritage:0 "Syrbotian Heritage"
 Moyan_heritage_desc:0 "Jebel-Moya, the site which the sphere of all Moyan culture surrounds, can be found in a quite old and well-trodden great plain hemmed in by massifs (compact mountain chains). With a great floodplain created by the Blue Nile and a unique freshwater source replenished by both the White and Blue Niles, Jebel Moya and Moya at large have been able to support pastoral communities for millennia, with massive grave sites belonging to shepherds long past. The Syrboti tribesmen frequent these fertile plains to feed their personal animals and herds of cattle which have been found in mass graves. Perhaps their reliance on cattle and their milk is the reason why these people supposedly grow eight cubits in height on average."
 ###Megabaria
 Borasan_heritage:0 "Megabarian Heritage"
 Borasan_heritage_desc:0 "Centered around the watercourse of the Black Nile which branches off from the main Nile as it bends and then turns and winds its way up into the mountains, the Megabari tribe survived as a thriving avenue of exotic trade. It was both connected to Kush and Egypt and, by extension, the Mediterranean sphere in the north, as well as the Aksumite/Arabian conjunction near the entrance of the Red Sea. While the people may be seen by outsiders as uncivilized barbarians, those same outsiders are quite happy to import Bush Elephants and rich metals in quite large quantities from the tribesmen. Some believe them to have settled in a city of Apollo, where the sun always shines. Some say they have witnessed members of this tribe feasting off the flesh of elephants. How civilized the whole place is is truly a question."
 ###Aksum
 Axumite_heritage:0 "Aksumite Heritage"
 Axumite_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly born from the declining D`mt kingdom, Aksum grew to power as a centralized mixture of native Aetheopian and trade-induced Sabaean and South Arabian influences which brought their semitic gods with them. This mixture of cultures led to monumental buildings worshiping different or mixed gods, and would lead to uniquely Axumite Semitic language. Aksum was also a major center for trade and resource distribution. Much of the ivory from elephants and rhinoceroses reaped from inland habits would wind up in Aksum before flowing out to the nearby ports like Adulis."
 ###Adoulia
 Adoulian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Island"
 Adoulian_heritage_desc:0 "Notably established by law, Adulis was a market port on the Red Sea, set opposite of the notable “Mountain Island,” which ships harbor at for safety. Possibly having gained its independence during the Classical Period with the disappearance of the D`mt kingdom in the 5th century BCE, the port town which may have once been a simple emporion became a much more popular trade city in a profitable location. It exported in great amounts both ivory and slaves, and was said to have been frequented most by the Troglodytae and Aetheopian natives from the interior lands."
 ###Gwanara
 Gwanaran_heritage:0 "Gwanaran Heritage"
 Gwanaran_heritage_desc:0 "Surrounded by mountains and forests fed by the source of the Black Nile which branches off eastwards of the main Nile river, Gwanara is home to the peoples the Mediterranean civilizations considered Troglodytae, cave-goers, Aethiopians, or Calf-Eaters, because they were seen as strange and oftentimes savage, hiding among the forests and exotic landscapes of southernmost known lands of greater Libya. Yet, it is from these lands and these people that the many riches of the area are produced and eventually end up in the hands of Macedonian aristocrats. This fact cannot be denied."
 ###Daamot
 Yehan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Timber-Frame Builders"
 Yehan_heritage_desc:0 "The old Somalian-Sabaean D'mt or Daamot kingdom began declining in the 5th century BCE, giving rise to Aksum, and its capital of Yeha was the site of at least one great palace and a temple dedicated to the Sabaean Moon God, Almaqah. The palace stands as one of if not the earliest timber-framed buildings in Eastern Africa, attesting to the master craftsmanship of the people living there. The city in which these monumental builds can be found nestled in a fertile valley, protected by protective mountains."
 ###Avalitia
 Avalitian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Little but the Good"
 Avalitian_heritage_desc:0 "Closest in travel to the Arabian shores on the opposite side of the Red Sea, Avalites was a port town which traded goods in small quantities but in great quality. This was especially the case when it came to Myrrh, that useful resin which flavors meals and covers the well-made product of the master carpenter. Those wishing to travel to Avalites had to do so by raft or boat, and those finding themselves in Avalites and wishing to leave had to do the same. This was especially true when it came to the frequent trade with the nearby Arabian town of Muza."
 ###Mundus
 Mundus_heritage:0 "Mocrotun Heritage"
 Mundus_heritage_desc:0 "One of the many city states which became an independent polity following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Mundus was larger in size than more periphery market towns, on the level of its westward neighbor, Malao. The port protected the harbored ships well, but may not have kept their sailors safe since the environment there has been considered ‘quarrelsome.’ Yet, while it imported many goods from all over, Mundus was best known for exporting a unique incense known as mocrotu, which was of better quality than the incense exported by the famous town of Mosylon, owner of the desirable Mosyllitic cinnamon."
 ###Opone
 Opone_heritage:0 "Crown of the Horn Heritage"
 Opone_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the tip of the Horn of Africa, Opone was one of the most well known cities with a port connecting the trade from India to the Red Sea, Egypt, and beyond. A city state having found independent rule following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Opone had always been a part of an incredibly rich history of cultural connection. In its graves lie relics of the ancient Mycenaeans as well as goods from all over the east and west. As for its own work, it was known to produce the greatest amount of cinnamon of any of the Somalian coastal cities, and it was known for having the greatest quality of tortoiseshell-wares in its markets."
 ###Elaia
 Elaian_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pearls"
 Elaian_heritage_desc:0 "These sandy outcrops dotting the Red Sea seem at first to hold no importance but, in truth, the people living there hold in their control a great deal of wealth, famous throughout the sea itself. What comes from these islands, sold by the so-called “Fish-Eaters,” for obvious reasons, are pearls in the hundreds and quality tortoiseshell and other marine-based wares. These products are what make the Alalaiou islands well-known, and they are favored by their proximity to the trading port of Adulis on the Libyan shore."
 ###Adabulia
 adabulia_heritage:0 "Adabulian Heritage"
 adabulia_heritage_desc:0 "These people lived in and around the desolate yet somewhat-rich town of Sinkat, which served as a point along the greater trade routes running from the coast to the far interior; the Black and main Nile rivers. Arabian tribesmen could be found doing some business here, possibly leading to an injection of their culture or the beginning of a conquest. Perhaps the interior of the desert and cliffsides can protect the Adabuli from foreign antagonism."
 ###Memnonia
 memnonia_heritage:0 "Memnonian Heritage"
 memnonia_heritage_desc:0 "The Memnones, not necessarily the tribe which gave birth to the myth of Memnon, prince of Tory, were a tribe surrounded by neighboring warbands as well as the powerful Kushite kingdom in the Isle of Meroe. A buffer between the Kushites and the increasingly forested southern lands which soon branch into heavy foliage cover. They benefited from the prosperity of this northern neighbor and the many routes of trade which existed between the Kushites and the southern tribes."
 ###Dabelia
 dabelia_heritage:0 "Dabelian Heritage"
 dabelia_heritage_desc:0 "The lands of the Dabeli tribe from north to south are a stretch of a 20-day march. They were separated from the Kushites only by the small group of the Memnones, and were the first major group to be found on the trade routes following south from within the Isle of Meroe towards the more-wooded areas closer to the bend in the Blue Nile."
 ###Dabelia
 critensia_heritage:0 "Critensian Heritage"
 critensia_heritage_desc:0 "South of the Dabeli, the Critensi are a large tribe in the wooded areas far south of the Kushite lands and the immediate control of Meroe. This tribe could have been reached better by boats following the path of the Blue Nile rather than treading through the wild territory. Their neighbors, the Syrboti tribesmen who live in the wealthy lands between the White and Blue Niles, would have been great trading partners of animal products coming down the main Nile until it splits."
 ###Rizophagia
 rizophagia_heritage:0 "Rizophagian Heritage"
 rizophagia_heritage_desc:0 "With the Megabari tribes to the west and dry hills and deserts to the east which separate them from the prosperous sea, the Rizophagi, “Root-Eaters,” were one of several tribes known to have resided somewhere along the Black Nile along with the Attiri and the Babylleni. The Rizophagi can be found on the last bit of fertile lands before the onset of cliffs, empty hills, and deserts. Perhaps their roots give them great health and stamina in their conflicts against neighboring tribes…"
 ###Dochia
 dochia_heritage:0 "Dochian Heritage"
 dochia_heritage_desc:0 "The Dochi reside within the forests at the foot of the hilly landscape which quickly rises as one travels east in Puntland toward the coastal hinterlands. They benefited from the Black Nile running through their lands, which gave not only fish but fertility to the soil. For these reasons, the people were well-defended in their lands and could deter invaders even from great empires such as the Kushites far north."
 ###Gymnetia
 gymnetia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Nudity"
 gymnetia_heritage_desc:0 "Living along the end of the Black Nile and near the northern border of Lake Tana, the people of the Gymnetes lived a bountiful and free life, playing along the shores of a great river and a greater inland lake. When viewed by outsiders, they were distinguished first and foremost by their constant nudity, both in play and in battle and in every-day affairs. Perhaps it is this constant freedom which gives them such joy and a peaceful nature."
 ###Mai Adrasha
 mai_adrasha_heritage:0 "Heritage of Golden Earth"
 mai_adrasha_heritage_desc:0 "Settled upon soil with natural gold, this city and its surroundings were destined for greatness and prosperity. Mai Adrasha has been inhabited since at least the period of 1250 BCE and has since had a large metal-working industry with slag heaps all over the settlement. The city had trading links with Arabian ports and kingdoms and maintained their high production capacity in order to supply their hungry customers."
 ###Athagousia
 athagousia_heritage:0 "Athagousian Heritage"
 athagousia_heritage_desc:0 "Residing alongside the desert hills that formed the barrier of the more dry and uninhabitable areas farther north, the Athagausi found themselves in a small outcropping of civilization a ways from the general trade and passage routes from the coast to the interior of the landscape. The main settlement was at Akordat, a site which has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, sat upon the last good soil for pastoralism. Perhaps these people may find their local confines…limiting."
 ###Sembritia
 sembritia_heritage:0 "Sembritian Heritage"
 sembritia_heritage_desc:0 "The Sembritae, not to be confused in their name with the many “Deserters” who ran from Kushite and Egyptian settlements or were banished to the area west of the White Nile, were a tribe near to the “Frankincense Coast.” Their main settlement of Sembel was built as early as 800 BCE. It may have been one of the earlier and more successful pastoral and somewhat agricultural settlements in southeastern Libya until the rise of Daamot, then Aksum."
 ###Qohaito
 qohaito_heritage:0 "Qohaiton Heritage"
 qohaito_heritage_desc:0 "A pre-Axumite city, the people of Qohaito and the surrounding villages have lived in the area since the 5th millennium BCE. The settlement, west of the coastal port of Adulis and sat upon a high plateau, was fertile enough to sport small beds of crops in between village buildings and houses. Prosperity was brought to Qohaito because it sat along the trade routes between the kingdom of Axum proper and the coastal cities like Adulis. As a rest stop, Qohaito would have received a wide array of merchants from the Arabian, Libyan, and Mediterranean cultures."
 ###Malao
 malao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Fragrant Wood"
 malao_heritage_desc:0 "Settled at a pace of eight hundred stadia east of Avalites at the gates of Libya and Arabia, Malao was a more peaceful and prosperous port where Mediterranean merchants had to compete with Arabian traders from nearby kingdoms. The port was known for exporting its own wide selection of African cassia plants and harsh cinnamons as well as fragrant woods like duaka, kankamon, and makeir. These rarer goods shipped alongside smaller quantities of myrrh and frankincense which were found in great quantities all along the coast."
 ###Darayley
 darayley_heritage:0 "Heritage of Darayley"
 darayley_heritage_desc:0 "Set atop one of the few fertile plateaus in Puntland, Darayley benefits from easy access both to the markets in the closeby port of Malao as well as the imported goods and needs of the hinterland tribes and their productive populations. Exotic goods which came through this area included ostrich egg shells imported from southern ports along the general East Libyan trade system. The Sabaean culture had a presence here as indicated by stelae inscriptions."
 ###Berberia
 berberia_heritage:0 "Berberian Heritage"
 berberia_heritage_desc:0 "The fertile plateau just south of the “Frankincense Coast” of Puntland, formed by several river wadis and natural lakes, provided a home for many tribes and their villages. Berberia was a generalization from Mediterranean about diverse groups who lived in the hinterland of the many trading ports, and these people would often provide much of the manual labor for incense production as well as packing and transport of goods heading to port or farther into the interior where powerful chiefs ruled with large treasure holds."
 ###Shalcaw
 shalcaw_heritage:0 "Heritage of Shalcaw"
 shalcaw_heritage_desc:0 "One of several trade ports along the “Frankincense Coast,” Shlacaw was setup up on a stretch of the shoreline which could supply not only myrrh but fragrant woods and even some dates as commodities to incoming merchants who would bring in wares from Egypt or from the lands of the Indoi far to the east. Like its neighboring ports, Shalcaw brings in a large immigrating population of craftsmen and masters who refine the natural products that come in and are grown."
 ###Qandala
 qandala_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Gulf of Prosperity"
 qandala_heritage_desc:0 "Situated east of Mosylon on the greater Frankincense coast in Puntland, Qandala was another rich stop for traders on their way to and back from the coast of the Indoi kingdoms across the Erythraean sea. The port was well protected with natural promontories and was known for its exports in varieties of incense, gum, and some aromatic woods. For this safe and extensive trade, the port and its area were given the nickname Gacanka Hodonka, the “Gulf of Prosperity,” where the port fed off the riches of its neighbors and the strong routes of goods coming from the Indoi and southern Libya."

 aromata_heritage_desc:0 "Set upon the so-called “promontory of spices,” Aromata, related to the modern ‘aromatics,’ was one of the last in a chain of trading ports leading from the gates of Libya and Arabia to the great Erythraean Sea. The port itself produced a great quantity of resins and well-smelling herbs, yet it was its imports from the Indoi cities across the sea which gave it its most prized goods. Much-loved were its wide exports of Frankincense as well as the cassia plant, a form of cinnamon, which came from the far east beyond the Indoi themselves."
 ###Apocopa
 apocopa_heritage:0 "Apocopan Heritage"
 apocopa_heritage_desc:0 "One of the last trade ports before a coastal sailor reaches the ‘Small and Great Cliffs’ or the ‘Small and Great Beaches,’ which signal the beginning of the area known as Azania, Apocopa existed as a passage point for the ivory and other products of Bush Elephants. Other goods, such as gold, silver, exotic furs and the like also passed through the hands of merchants there, but the lucrative nature of the large tusks and the desire to hunt the beasts formed strong routes of consistent imports and transfer for Arabian and Mediterranean markets."
 ###Soqotra
 soqotra_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Isle of Bliss"
 soqotra_heritage_desc:0 "Surrounded by battering Monsoons and chaotic waters, the island which the Greeks called the ‘Island of the Dioscuri’ sits as a world so strange and alien to that of any other. Populated with many endemic species such as the dragon blood tree (the sap of which was greatly desired for its medicative properties), the island was a rich trading hub for myrrh as well as an exotic location for simple observation and wonder. Travelers from among the Greeks, Palmyrenes, Arabians, Bactrian and Ethiopian cities came to this place and were taken aback by its beauty and rich natural reserves. It was a meeting place for western and eastern merchants which heavily aided in the beginning of trans-Erythraean trade between the Indoi and the Mediterranean peoples. Besides its myrrh, frankincense, and tree sap and aloe, the island was also coveted for its tortoise shells, for even the bellies of the tortoises there were thick enough to make tables out of. Despite all these riches, the island remained sparsely inhabited, needing to import grain and wine to feed the few farmers."

## Arabian Heritages
 ###Lihyan
 Lihyan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Caravan Lords"
 Lihyan_heritage_desc:0 "An ancient kingdom stretching a large range of Arabia Felix, Lihyan served as an entity in its own right as well as a large trade and major stopping point for the Caravan Trade Route. The kings of Lihyan were central to political and religious affairs, having ceremonies and seasonal festivals dated to their reign. It began as the growing site of Dedan, and grew to be a centralized power, ruling from cities cut into the rocks, and became belligerent to their prospering Nabataean neighbors in the north."
 ###Qedar
 Qedar_heritage:0 "Qedaran Heritage"
 Qedar_heritage_desc:0 "Known as the most organized of the North Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were at the height of their expanse and influence during the 6th century BCE, but have since declined as a result of many factors including the growth and centralization of coastal states like Lihyan and the Nabataeans. They were mainly pastoralists who became wealthy with the trade of animal products along the Caravan Trade routes and in between the desert oases. There is evidence of cross-cultural motivations between these Arabian groups and the centralized Aramean states, as noted by Aramean names associated with Qedarites having lived near the border of the north or having been part of the integrated or assimilated tribes which moved about the peripheries of sedentary kingdoms."
 ###Thamuda
 Thamuda_heritage:0 "Heritage of the First Arabian Kingdom"
 Thamuda_heritage_desc:0 "Attested as early as the late 8th century BCE by contemporary texts, Thamuda, even though it was more of a tribal confederation, was the first kingdom in Arabia. Sargon II claimed to have conquered these people as well as others, exporting them to Samaria, but that Sargon claimed a great many things in his lifetime which cannot all be the accomplishments of one person. Ruled by a local leader instead of an anointed king, their aristocratic class could not have been terribly stable."
 ###Gerrha
 Gerrha_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Obscenely Rich"
 Gerrha_heritage_desc:0 "These people were supposedly the richest of the Arabs, continuing the life of the prosperity the previous Dilmun civilization experienced, which extended back to the Bronze Age, facilitating much of the trade through the Persian Gulf from India and Eastern Persia into Mesopotamia and, likely, beyond. These men and women were so rich, in fact, that the city of Gerrha was described as having “fancy tools made out of gold and silver, such as the family gold” and “doors, walls, roofs filled with colors, gold, silver, and holy stones.” It is clear that these people lacked little and wanted for nothing, living such prosperous lives. Whomever should lay claim to their land and their lifestyle would find themselves equally rich and carefree."
 ###Maka
 Maka_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Magan Lords"
 Maka_heritage_desc:0 "The Lords of Magan (Akkadian Makkan) have been recorded since the time of the Sumerians, as early as 2,600 BCE. These famed lords and their domains and their well-built ships brought trade to the region, facilitating goods having come from the Indian and Bactrian area as they traveled into Mesopotamia. The land of Magan also supplied its people and their trade with a great deal of Myrrh and Frankincense, desirable luxuries since time immemorial. These people likely came under the rule of, or at least cooperated with, the Persian empire either during the Cyrus the Great`s reign or during that of Darius I. They remained important trading partners and controlled the flow of goods into the Persian gulf at the point where Arabia and Persia meet."
#Jubbah
 jubbah_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Desert Lake-People"
 jubbah_heritage_desc:0 "Since the Mesolithic period, the travelers of the Arabian deserts have enjoyed the sanctuary known as Jubbah. Amongst all the dry and dusty Nefud desert, this one place sat as a surprisingly wet spot where water collected and supported life and even agriculture. The settlement has also acted as a funnel for trade from the center of the peninsula to the northwest where the Nabataeans lie, and art depicting gazelles, monkeys, birds, and other exotic animals show the variety of creatures and goods brought through its caravanserais by far-traveled merchants. Because it is a geological anomaly in the region and a valuable confluence of trade, the Arabs here have always been uniquely settled into the area - a stark contrast from the Bedouin peoples all around them."
# Tasm
 tasm_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Najd"
 tasm_heritage_desc:0 "Nestled in the agriculturally-viable al-Kharj oasis zone of the Najd plateau region of Arabia, the Tasm are regarded as an old and respected tribe, living comfortably within their vegetative home, poised constantly to reach out and strike against the less-fortunate tribes in the deserts and dusty hills. Able to support a larger population and sell their agricultural goods abroad, the Tasm were a wealthier tribe too, wielding the central power of the peninsula. They were a more urbanized people of Arabia, supporting dense settlements along creek-beds. At times, these people found kinship with the settled Arabs of the south in Saba, and could find political will to support that kingdom against its enemies."
# Jadis
 jadis_heritage:0 "Jadisite Heritage"
 jadis_heritage_desc:0 "The sister tribe of Tasm, Jadis was forever caught between the well-watered Tasmites to the north and the settled kingdoms to the south such as Saba, who favored the Tasmites, the Jadisites were often abused politically by their powerful neighbors. Sabaean royal beds hosting Jadisites was not unheard of and was a tool of the throne to control the lineage of the tribesmen. The question remained whether to continue subsisting under Sabaean pressure, submit to the Tasmite threat, or learn how to take control of the rocky corridors and squeeze the trade lanes in order to make their neighbors kneel."
#Kindah
 kindah_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Unlucky Arabs"
 kindah_heritage_desc:0 "Expelled from the lands of Tylos and Gerrha, the Kindites have had to withdraw across the Najd over the ages, their identity, culture, and population fading over the ages. In their final sanctuary they have impressed a structure upon their society and have built a great settlement for themselves to thrive in. The question remains as to how long this respite from misfortune will last, or whether they have truly turned over a new rock."
# 'Aad
 aad_heritage:0 "Heritage the Truly Lost Tribe"
 aad_heritage_desc:0 "Settled in the sparsely-populated cliffs and crevices of the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the ‘Aadites were a people rarely seen by outsiders, almost wholly forgotten by even their neighbors. It has been said that, on rare and dangerous occasions, their rash worship brings upon the land they inhabit raging storms which dwarf all those found in or outside Arabia, and these storms are a blessing and a curse. They feed the peoples thirst, but even in the desert the storms could drown what is left of the Aadites, even their memory and that of the famed markets of Ubar, from which thousands of sacks of frankincense were always sold."
#Samad
 samad_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Date Farmers"
 samad_heritage_desc:0 "At times nomads and at others settled peoples, the southeastern Omani tribes of Samad herded no animal beyond the stubborn date, eating it with so high a frequency that their diet was considered disastrous yet delectable. Some say the Achaemenids had come to dominate this place prior for the sole purpose of consuming the fruit."
 ###Tylos

 tylosian_heritage_desc:0 "Tylos is an island off the coast of East Arabia. Famed for its cotton products, they are sold as far away as the Indian courts and even on the other side of the Arabian desert."
##Scythian Greek Missions Heritages
 thyssagetia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Lonely Nomads"
 thyssagetia_heritage_desc:0 "Separated from their neighbors by a vast, deserted stretch of land in many directions, the Thyssagetae lived almost in the realm of mythology when thought of by their neighbors. An Iranian-speaking tribe likely of Sarmatian stock, the Thyssagetae seasonally traveled along the river called Thisageta to pasture their horses."
 jurcae_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sturdy Steppe Folk"
 jurcae_heritage_desc:0 "Lying north of the Aral Sea, the Jurcae, also known as the Iurcae or the Turcae (not related to the modern Turks), traveled desolate and arid plains and hills, crossing vast distances between each source of water. To keep their herds safe was a difficult task alone, not considering the threat of a more eastern tribe migrating into and forcing them out of their pastures or the threat of the cold in the north sweeping down to burden them now and again. Thus, the Jurcae were a toughened people, stronger and more strategic than even the legendary Arimaspii."
 yancai_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 100,000 Archers"
 yancai_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes referred to as the “Upper Aorsi,” the Yancai were a truly fearsome and powerful group. Their enemies, a group which included their neighbors in all directions, were terrified of the thought of the supposedly 100,000-strong archer-force which the Yancai could muster. Their fame reached the far east in Chinese records, and the greatest powers in the west looked forward in dread to their eventual exodus from the steppes."
 derbicia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Cyrus' Bane"
 derbicia_heritage_desc:0 "Some legends still tell how Cyrus the Great’s last blow came from a tribesman of the Derbices, how the Saka Haumavarga, Cyrus’s allies, had to then fight off that tribe. Neighbors to the Dahae tribes, the Derbices have, over time, been purchased from their southern home on the border of the Achaemenid realm of old. They worshiped the mother goddess Api most of all."
 apasiciai_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Water-Sakas"
 apasiciai_heritage_desc:0 "Living along the Syr Darya river and the eastern coast of the Aral Sea, the Apasiacae were a tribe dependent on the gifts of the rivers and their waters, herding their animals along the banks and driving their horses through the waterbed reeds. These people experience an easier life than their dry-steppe-bound cousin tribes and they benefit from their natural advantage by growing, spreading, and prospering. "
 aspisia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Good Horses"
 aspisia_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes called the Hippasii in reference to their famed horses of strong stock, the Aspisii train their herds to roam the more rugged yet still fertilized lands north of the Aral Sea and the Syr Darya, where the land has been witness to the great migrations of many steppe tribes and their horse lords. Out of all the Sakas, they were among the more open-minded, sometimes learning from slaves taken and tradesmen seen from the eastern mountains. "
 iazygian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Iazyges"
 iazygian_heritage_desc:0 "Westernmost of the currently classified 'Sarmatian' groups, the Iazyges were the first to ride through the old land of the declining Scythians long after the golden age of their King Ateas. Riding on horses shining with armor, wielding the long, two-handed kontos spear, they eventually crossed the Tyras as the Cimmerians had once done and lived in the land of the Dacians, fighting the locals and, soon enough, the invading Roman legions."
 roxolani_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Roxolani"
 roxolani_heritage_desc:0 "The second 'Sarmatian' group to cross the Dnieper after the Iazyges, the Roxolani were similar to those before them, riding well-armored horses and dominating the plains. After failing to conquer the Bosporans alongside the Scythians in the Crimea they moved on, past the Tyras, and entered Dacia/Moesia, coming into conflict with the natives and their Roman neighbors."
 aorsi_heritage:0 "Aorsian Heritage"
 aorsi_heritage_desc:0 "Recorded by both eastern and western sources as a powerful, expansionist tribe, they factored largely in the many instances of westward migrations across the Pontic-Caspian steppe.

Gedrosia is an almost barren rock populated by mountains and deserts, a stark contrast to the great Erythraean Sea lying below it, which Nearchus sailed as he matched Alexander in his fateful journey. Though it is a dead land, there are those few souls who live there - the fish-eaters - as they are known, the Ichthyophagi. They must be a cursed people, to live their lives in such a harsh and unforgiving place."
 ###Arachosia
 arachosia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Rusty Silver Shields"
 arachosia_heritage_desc:0 "Dating back to the Achaemenid period, as seen in Elamite inscriptions from Persepolis, the land of Arachosia, home to the Arachoti, or Pactyans, was largely unnotable except for the fact that it provided a great quantity of ivory for use in the palace in Susa of Darius I. When Alexander conquered Arachosia alongside the rest of the former eastern Persian satrapies, he placed his general, Sibyrtius in charge of the area. When the Diadochi wars broke out, the general kept his post, and long after Antigonus won the famous Argyraspides, the “Silver Shields,” from Eumenes, he sent many of them to Sibyrtius with orders to get them all killed by means of dangerous missions - they were to uncontrollable to be kept alive."

 satrapy_parthia_heritage_desc:0 "As a region, the history of Parthia traces all the way back to the 7th century BCE and its conquest by the Median Empire and other parts of the Middle East. During the next few centuries, the vassal area would change hands, from the Medians to the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BCE, and from them to the Alexandrian Macedonian Empire and, soon after, the Seleucid Empire in the 4th century BCE. The size of Parthia also fluctuated as larger empires who controlled it changed the administrative methods of the landscape. By the time of Seleucid rule, Parthia was appended to the Hyrcania administrative unit. While under Alexander and the Seleukids, Parthian rule changed hands between several Macedonian war-time generals and noblemen, and remained oftentimes unstable as a background satrapy, far away from the frontlines and capital of its respective overlords. This allowed for its rebellious nature to grow, and perhaps the Macedonian governors were simply keeping the seat warm for someone better…"

Believing their royal line to have come down from Achaemenid King Artaxerxes II, they carry a great claim of legitimacy to rule the Iranian plateau, reportedly speaking a language between Scythian and Median, but were more likely to have simply been a Scythian tribe which migrated from south into to the Orchus river along with many other tribes which took up residence along the greater Oxus river as part of the great wave of nomadic migrations."

These people, as an individual tribe or as the leader of a tribal confederation, dominated the area and caused chaos for Persian and Western rulers as early as the 8th century BCE.

This Bronze Age civilization has also been called the Bactria-Margiana civilization/complex. The land is fraught with many ancient myths and possibilities, with later Islamic scholars proclaiming that mythical figures such as the king Afrasiab founded the ancient Khwarazmian kingdom. This man, Afrasiab, has been etymologically identified with the Persian Parsondes, king of the Cadusii and famed for his part in the issue of legendary Median and Persian conflict. A cultural mix of late Sakan and Bactrian peoples, Khwarazm was a bastion of civilization hidden among the deserts, famed for its 50 fortresses guarding the oasis."

It is no wonder that, holed up in their Matienian homeland of moutnains and the lake, they built forts to keep foreigners out and proctect themselves the best they could. Within the Ziwiyeh fort, their prayers to Teshub and the god's kind awarded their salvation...for a time. It is time for their throne to once again be a seat of power."

Their name consisted of the characters for moon and clan, giving a unique distinction and suggestion about their character. While they were a significant force to create political and military problems for settled states such as those in China, they were also well known for assisting the transmission of Jade to the east, as well as military-horses which they raised and trained themselves. While they were still unsettled nomads, they traded these rare goods for silk and other luxuries which they both used for themselves and sent west along what would become the Silk Road. Their artwork reflected both a Scytho-Sarmatian steppe-heritage in its animalistic designs while also showing Chinese influences in the stylistic means of portraying certain animals. Although they could supposedly host a horde army of over one hundred thousand strong, their power north of the Tian Shan range was constantly threatened and checked by other strong confederations, such as the Xiongnu."
 ###Kucha
 kucha_heritage:0 "Kuchan Heritage"
 kucha_heritage_desc:0 "The most fertile, civilized and populated of all the Tarim-Basin oases, Kucha was a bastion of civilization along the harsh desert and snowy mountains. It acted as a major trading station in the eastern to western connection which would become the famed Silk Road, but the land also maintained an air of holiness, being home to many peaceful monks among the mountains. In war, they were noted for the strength of their chainmail armor which was fashioned in kind to the Iranian west. For travelers and merchants, it was the land of many fortressed cities living at the edge of the world."
 ###Shule
 shule_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Jade Gate"
 shule_heritage_desc:0 "At the foot of the Pamir mountains which connect to the Tian-Shan and the Himalayan ranges, Saka-speaking Shule sits at the beginning of the northern elements of what would become the Silk Road, at the western entrance of the Tarim Basin. Its capital, Kashgar, named for the same river which weaves its way through the mountains, guards the Yumen Pass, better known as the Jade Gate. Almost all trade in the area must come through this kingdom if the merchants wish for their goods to reach larger markets beyond the oases kingdoms."
 ###Phrynia
 phrynia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Toads"
 phrynia_heritage_desc:0 "Set within the heartland of the Pamir mountains, the mysterious Phryni live in a place of isolation from outsiders. These Scythian/Sakan clans live in what may be the modern day Hunza Valley, which follows the Hunza river and was a bed of mixture between the Bon and Buddhist faiths in the region as they transferred across the mountains on the backs of caravans. These people, while inhabiting a confined mountain-space, would have controlled trade routes in the region from with territorial influence around all the Pamir mountains."
 ###Pishan
 pishan_heritage:0 "Pishan Heritage"
 pishan_heritage_desc:0 "Pishan was a caravan hub and trading stop which sat at the beginning of many paths into the Pamir mountains and other mountain valleys. Bearing 500 fighting men, the settlement of Pishan itself and its kingdom were miniscule, but served as junctions of trade between China and Arachosia or the Indian subcontinent. A great few people earned a great sum of money with this trade."
 ###Khotan
 khotan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Land of Cows"
 khotan_heritage_desc:0 "Known in Sanskrit as “The Land of Cows,” Khotan was a land of prosperity and cultural beauty. Noted as one of the earliest Buddhist states in history and a Saka-speaking nation, its strange mixture of identities was the result of its being  great connection point between the major trade lines connecting China, the Indian subcontinent, and Central Asia where other Tarim-Basin oasis cities only connected one or two areas."
 ###Yumi
 yumi_heritage:0 "Yumi Heritage"
 yumi_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes known as Hanmi, the domain of Yumi runs from the trade town of ancient Keriya south to Wumi and the submontaine track known as Tagh, which follows the river Keriya down to its connection with the river Chira. The oasis and the rivers provided both a place for cultivation and paths for trade along the desert border and into the mountains. Luxury goods would pass by here with merchants, but the people also crafted their own goods, some jadesmiths, some working with rich chalcedony, and some molding forms with the deposits of gold found in hidden places. Due to trade over the mountains, the people of Yumi held, in some respects, cultural borrowings from the Indian Gandharan area, having wall frescoes depicting Greco-Buddhist. However, like neighboring Khotan, they also adopted cultural elements from the Persians, the Chinese, and held their own native Tocharian practices."
 ###Jingjue
 jingjue_heritage:0 "Jingjue Heritage"
 jingjue_heritage_desc:0 "The Jinjue capital of Cadota (the ancient name of the Niya archaeological site) was at one point a major center in the southern trade path in the Tarim Basin, if not one of the largest oases in the region. Because of its size and wealth, the city was known for even having fruit orchards along with limited farmland and pastoralists on the periphery. The kingdom of Jinjue was both an integral part of the Tocharian-speaking community on the border of the desert and a willing participant in cultural influence abroad, with Indic elements having been adopted possibly from merchants coming over the Himalayas."
 ###Xiaowan
 xiaowan_heritage:0 "Xiaowan Heritage"
 xiaowan_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes also known as Xiao Yuan, or “Little Yuan,” Xiaowan was a secluded settlement south of the southern route in the Taklamakan averaging a population of only around a thousand. The people were thus mostly pastoralist herdsmen who loosely controlled the small valleys snaking between the mountains. Lying out of the way of the main routes, the culture was more isolated than in other Tocharian settlements around the great desert, so it would not have adopted Indic or Chinese influences as readily as its neighbors."
 ###Weitou
 weitou_heritage:0 "Weitou Heritage"
 weitou_heritage_desc:0 "A small land located at a key fork in the summer route from modern Aksu to Kashgar, Weitou held strategic control on trade coming from the northern route to the west where the Fergana valley could be found with its heavenly horses. The people of Weitou, sharing many qualities with the cultures of that valley and the steppe-lands north of it, practiced lowland agriculture in the fashion of the Central Asian steppe-peoples where they could, flanked by high mountains and the harsh desert."
 ###Gumo
 gumo_heritage:0 "Gumo Heritage"
 gumo_heritage_desc:0 "Known for its strong fighting force of several thousand for such an isolated area, as well as its local production of copper, iron, and orpiment - traded to the west as a weapon-enhancer and to the east as a component in medicine - the so-called kingdom of Gumo straddled the border between the mountain-side kingdoms of the Tarim Basin which sat against the inner desert and the nomadic peoples outside the elevation crater, such as the Amyrgi tribe and their neighbors. The capital of the kingdom, known as Nancheng, or “Southern City,” could be found well south of modern Aksu, which was called Gumo. The capital may have benefitted from its location near where the Aksu and Khotan rivers meet the Kashgar. This location provided many more favorable means of travel than along the desert itself, and would have diverted much trade to pass through the kingdom."
 ###Qiemo
 qiemo_heritage:0 "Qiemo Heritage"
 qiemo_heritage_desc:0 "Settled during the Bronze Age as part of the original Jade Road which connected Chinese and Ferghana markets, Qiemo (the capital being located at modern Charchan) remained a small kingdom of only a few thousand people at most. Cave wall paintings and mummies verify that Qiemo handled trade from the Tibet region and the Bon-faith settlements that dotted the Himalayas, whether through direct connections over the mountains or from other Taklamakan cities. Besides its markets and material goods open for trade, Qiemo had its own fruit orchards and grape vineyards, giving it an ability to supply unique foods to its neighbors."

## Northern Heritages
 ### Gelonia
 gelonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Three Keeps"
 gelonia_heritage_desc:0 "It is said the Gelonians, or the Gelonii, are sons of Greek Gelonus, who himself was the son of Herakles and brother of Scythes. It is also said that the city of Gelon, which is all wooden and sometimes referred to also as Helon, is home to Greek people having forgone their lives in the coastal emporia. In Gelon, the citizens speak a language between Greek and Scythian, as they are influenced by the surrounding clans of the Budini, who live in the forests to the north and also in the territory around the city itself. Within its great walls and the three fortified keeps, there many workshops and stalls can be found where craftsmen and goldsmiths play at their work, manufacturing great wonders and art for the nobility and for trade. At the edge of the Great Steppe, where the northern treeline and the far reaches of the cold desert to the north begin, the city stands as the last civilized place in all the world."
 ### Budinia
 budinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Camouflaged Reindeer"
 budinia_heritage_desc:0 "The Budini are a hidden tribe, numerous in number, but kept in secrecy by the many forests which they inhabit. Their territory lies north of and around the great wooden city and fort of Gelon, which holds Greeks and Scythians. Some say the Budini themselves speak a Scythian tongue, yet others say that those tree-dwellers with blue eyes speak a tongue belonging to forest-folk. They are clothed in many furs, and wandering travelers have claimed to have seen reindeer the size of an ox moving between the bushes in the treeline, who are hard to see because their fur changes its hue across the seasons."
 ### Borysthenia
 borysthenia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Borysthenia"
 borysthenia_heritage_desc:0 "Those people living along the river Borysthenes live a good life off of the rich river-fed lands and the wealth of trees which dot the northern landscape. Ages ago, in the seventh century, the first Scythian peoples came into these lands, invading and besieging the biggest local forts. Once those living along the river had been conquered, they continued in daily activities under the watch of Scythian nobility, maintaining many traditional customs and values and seeing the administrative guidance of the steppe lords."
 ### Melanchlaenia
 melanchlaenia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Black-Cloaks"
 melanchlaenia_heritage_desc:0 "The Melanchlaeni, who are almost themselves a myth, live to the far north, beyond the Budini and east of the cannibalistic Androphagi. Their name, which is known only to the Greeks, surely refers to the dark hides they wear over their bodies, for thick hides provide a great deal of insulation in the harsh cold and the gales of the winds which funnel through the clusters of trees. Should the clans of these tribes travel south, one may imagine they will move in the night like bodiless shadows, striking in the dark and drawing terror over all the settled world."
 ### Neuria
 neuria_heritage:0 "Heritage of Lycanthropy"
 neuria_heritage_desc:0 "The Neuri are only separated from the many Scythian groups by the river Tyras, themselves living along the Hypanis. Yet, while they may have looked across the Scythians on the other side of the river, they practiced many Scythian customs, mixing them with their own. Perhaps this came about when they were driven out of their homeland by a great army of snakes, and left to live among the Budini for a while, whom Greeks say speak a Scythian language. Yet, they returned, and conquered the serpentine lands, possibly using their powers of lycanthropy, for the the members of the Neuri, they say, on occasion take the form of a wolf for a few days in the year."
 ### Agathyrsia
 agathyrsia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Estranged Cousin"
 agathyrsia_heritage_desc:0 "The Agathyrsi are a mut-people, exhibiting characteristics one may call Scythian, Thracian, Celtic, and Venetic at different times. They live by the Carpathians at the edge of the western steppe, but these people were still descendants of the divine son Agathyrsus, and trace their lineage with the Scythians themselves. They each take many wives, and are a luxurious and greedy bunch, sleeping with the wives of their close friends on many occasions. They were once much closer to the Scythians of the Pontic Steppe but, after they killed the Scythian King Ariapeithes they have estranged themselves, and live in isolation."
 ### Carpia
 carpia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Carpi"
 carpia_heritage_desc:0 "The Carpi are a people tied to the great mountains, which they may either take their name from or give a name to, the Carpathians. The Carpi themselves are another mutt-tribe, hard to distinguish in their shared Dacian, Getic, and Sarmato-Scythian elements. What is known is that they are belligerent people, and have a great history of invasion and sustained war, which their neighbors fear them for. The only way to avoid their attacks is to join them."
 ### Aroteria
 aroteria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Steppe Farmers"
 aroteria_heritage_desc:0 "The Aroteres are a Scythian people, or at least a Scythian-ruled people. They grow many cereals on the fertile lands next to crisscrossing rivers and river tributaries, but they are not just consumers. They sell this bounty to the Pontus Euxinos below and to the wide sea beyond, giving the area the title of “Bread Basket,” along others such as the Nile Delta. It is likely that these people came under Scythian rule and themselves became in blood and practice Scythians by the end of the 7th century BCE migrations, when the natives were hard-pressed to capitulate to the immigrating steppe lords and their wide herds and hordes."
 ### Alizonia
 alizonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Alizones"
 alizonia_heritage_desc:0 "The Alizones can be found between the coastal Callipidae, who are themselves part Greek and part Scythian in nature, and the up-river Aroteres, who are great farmers and enjoy the sowing and the reaping of their cereal grains. They are ruled by Scythians, and have themselves adopted Scythian customs through blood and assimilation, but exist as a rather calm and servile nation, happily living off the endless plains."

## Indian Heritages
 ###Gandhara
 gandhara_heritage:0 "Gandharan Heritage"
 gandhara_heritage_desc:0 "One of the 16 ancient mahajanapadas, or Indian kingdoms, Gandhara was featured as one of the western kingdoms in the Mahabharata and Ramayana Epic Poems. Famed in these texts for its founder, Prince Gandhara, son of Druhyu, and Prince Shakuni, himself a cause of the legendary Kurukshetra War, Gandhara was an important border point between India and the western world. India was rudely introduced to these powers militarily when King Darius I marched through the Khyber Pass and conquered the kingdom. From that point on, Gandhara would serve as the subject of larger groups, transferring from the state of a Persian satrapy to a Macedonian Greek satrapy following the conquest of Alexander, and then that of the Seleukids, before it would finally be transferred back to Indian control as a part of the vast Mauryan Empire. However, under foreign rule, the cities of Peshawar and Taxila thrived with the introduction of more efficient government and became centers of wealth and technological and faith reform."
 ###Khamboja
 khamboja_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ashvakas"
 khamboja_heritage_desc:0 "One of the 16 mahajanapadas, or Great Kingdoms in India, the Khambojas were originally a set of tribes which coalesced over time into a stable polity. Their history is set back within the time of the Mahbharata, when the Epic protagonist Karna, son of the god Surya, defeated the Khambojan King Sudakshina. These peoples were set apart from their neighbors for their warrior caste system and adherence to non-Brahmanical sacred rituals. They were fearsome on the battlefield, fighting their own enemies and the enemies of their allies or employers with their famed Ashvakas, which may have been known to the Greeks as Aspasioi."
 ###Paurava
 paurava_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Puru"
 paurava_heritage_desc:0 "Some believe the Pauravas and Greek-recorded king Porus came from the Regvedic Era Puru tribal confederation which fought in the great Battle of the Ten Kings (where they were defeated alongside their allies). For their own part, the Pauravas dwelling in the Punjab region were conquered by the Achaemenids as part of the Hindush satrapy in 525 BCE, but had achieved independence under the recorded Porus by around 338 BCE. The army of king Porus was the last great obstacle in the campaign of Alexander the Great, and would be the frontier region between the Hellenic world and the greater East under Chandragupta and the Mauryan empire conquered it in the beginning of a push back against Hellenic dominion."
 ###Khasa
 khasa_heritage:0 "Khasan Heritage"
 khasa_heritage_desc:0 "The Khasas belonged to one of the later Janapada kingdoms which served as subservient border realms to the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the great janapadas. These people, though they dwelled by the Himalayas, were termed ‘Indian’ in the Rigvedic literature and by the Roman historian Pliny. In the Mahabharata, the Khasas, along with many other tribes, served as protectors of the sage Vashistha and his cow, providing a shield for the holy."
 ###Yaudheya
 yaudheya_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kshatriya Warriors"
 yaudheya_heritage_desc:0 "Rising as a powerful group out of the declining corpse of the Kuru Kingdom, the Yaudheya were first recorded in the grammatical work Ashtadhyayi and the Ganapatha by the classical-age Sanskrit philologist Panini. Their most important figures and societal values relied on the Kshatriya varna of Vedic thought and thus they were a powerful warrior society, their name even deriving from the word for warrior. As conquerors they consolidated the old lands of the Kuru and took those of the Pauravas as well before contesting their independence against the onslaught of Maurya."
 ###Nabhaka
 nabhaka_heritage:0 "Nabhakan Heritage"
 nabhaka_heritage_desc:0 "This region and its people would later be known through the rock edicts of Ashoka when he had conquered the great northern territories of the Indian subcontinent, but they are little-known elsewhere. A tribe of the dardic peoples, they are part of an old tradition of tribes straddling the mountains to the north and the lowlands to the south where the great armies march along flat fields. They have the advantage of the high ground, and may soon prey upon the cities dotting the landscape before returning to their mountain home."
 ###Zhangzhung
 zhangzhung_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Silver Palace of Garuda"
 zhangzhung_heritage_desc:0 "Ancient and long-term inhabitants of the western Tibetan plateau, the people of Zhangzhung, or those of the zhangzhung culture were well-established at least by the fifth century BCE and comprised three regions, those being sGob-ba, Phug-pa, and Bar-ba. While their culture came about before the Buddhist conversion of the region and their mainly worshiped the Bon practices following the end of the Macedonian Empire, they retained a close contact with the Vedic tribes to the south; their capital of Khyunglung was both place for Bon monasteries, a meetingplace for Bonpo magicians, and is regarded as a palace-home to the Vedic god Garuda."
 ###Nabhapakti
 nabhapakti_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Nepala"
 nabhapakti_heritage_desc:0 "While the term Nepal, or Nepala, was known as early as the fourth century BCE from Vedic texts, it is unknown how long the people of the region that would become known for their remote livelihoods and Buddhist monasteries had lived there before this Classical-Era record. Coming from an Indian tradition, Buddhism only had a small foothold among the realms of humanity, but the Nabhapakti people were its stronghold."
 ###Tsang
 tsang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tsang"
 tsang_heritage_desc:0 "A part of the mountainous heartland of the Tibet people and their isolated and rugged landscape and lifestyle, Tsang serves as a tall, cold barrier against outside interference, but also a cage which holds in its inhabitants. The people there worship the Bon faith, but have been slowly introduced to the Buddhist tradition that will eventually establish itself in the region. Its few towns and cities, like the capital of Zhongzhong give the impression of an orderly, balanced society, with chess-board-like street planning. What a comfy, quiet, peaceful life… may it last long."
 ###Sumpa
 sumpa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Qiang"
 sumpa_heritage_desc:0 "The Chinese peoples called the inhabitants of Sumpa the Qiang, which were the main adversaries of Shang dynasty of the second millennium BCE. Situated in the northeastern Tibet region, these people were not only antagonists to the Chinese, but were also raiders and at times invaders in the eyes of the Tarim Basin kingdoms which revolved around vulnerable trade routes tucked between the harsh desert and the rugged mountains. While they lived in difficult conditions, the people of Sumpa have had ample opportunity to reap the benefits of the weakness of their neighbors."
 ###Yarlung
 yarlung_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yarlung"
 yarlung_heritage_desc:0 "Little is known of the dynasty of Yarlung as a pre-Tibetan Empire or kingdom, other than that they were fierce. The Yarlung Valley supported the local dynasty due to its bountiful lowlands among the mountains and its unique fruit orchards boasting apples and pears. This valley served as a crucial trade route junction into India and the other mountain-dwelling kingdoms."
 ###Kamarupa
 kamarupa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Slow and Steady"
 kamarupa_heritage_desc:0 "A frontier kingdom beyond the domain of the Mauryan empire and largely out of the records and considerations of the rest of Indian literature and history, the people and kingdom of Kamarupa were a long-lasting tribe which controlled a large swath of fertile land in the Brahmaputra Valley and absorbed its sister iron-age kingdom of Davaka in the fifth century BCE. They may have been a smaller power than the great Mahajanapadas and then the greater Indian empires, but patience has its rewards…"
 ###Samatata
 samatata_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sounagoura"
 samatata_heritage_desc:0 "The Greco-Roman knew this place as Sounagoura, for there was a trading post in this place with such a name from which many fine and exotic goods came from. The port in question sat at the mouth of the Brahmaputra River, which itself flowed down from the Himalayas to the Meghna River and then the Bay of Bengal. This watercourse provided the boon of fresh water and travel out into the sea, where many goods could find their homes in Indian, Persian, and Mediterranean ports."
 ###Mahiladvipika
 mahiladvipika_heritage:0 "Mahiladvipikan Heritage"
 mahiladvipika_heritage_desc:0 "A large collection of natural atolls and islets, the archipelago surrounding the legendary island of Mahiladvipika was the home of rather-isolated populations, originally comprised of a mix of Southwestern Indian and Northwestern Sri Lankan peoples, but later influenced by the supposed arrival of the Sinhalese people in the 6th century BCE as Magadha exiles. The island chain sits at an important waypoint straddling the Indian-Red Sea route, and contributed to the general Erythraean Sea connectivity. Buddhism would soon take grip of several of the atolls, inspiring cultural renovation and innovation in order to create a Maldive identity."
 ###Mahisamandala
 mahisamandala_heritage:0 "Mahisamandalan Heritage"
 mahisamandala_heritage_desc:0 "Running along the border of the Narbada River with its capital on an island, this land is home to rocky slopes as much as it is a heartland for farmsteads and fields of grain. Yet, it is also a home to the religiously curious. The legendary Mahadeva of the Buddhist faith practiced here, who is known in stories as a bringer of wisdom as much as a bringer of chaos and uncertainty, having been both a sinner and a monk."
 ###Atavia
 atavia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Forest-Dwellers"
 atavia_heritage_desc:0 "The Atavi people wear the badge of defeat against the mighty Sahdeva in the time of the Mahabharata. Their home is the great forest, from which their name derives, is the one place they can remain safe and isolated whilst stuck in the midst of the grappling great powers around them such as Maurya to the north."
 ###Rathika
 rathika_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Charioteers"
 rathika_heritage_desc:0 "The word Rathika means “charioteers,” which will say a great deal about the people who lived here. They may not have been the first to take up the horse-pulled war-cart, but they may have been the masters of the chariots by the time of the waning years of the war-machine."
 ###Bhoja
 bhoja_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yadu"
 bhoja_heritage_desc:0 "The Bhojas, a southern tribe of the Satvatas clan, come from the ancient Yadavas. In the Mahabharata they are called mlecchas, barbarians of incomprehensible speech, opposed to the Aryans and unable to achieve ultimate nirvana. The line of Bhoja prince once ruled over the Vedic-age kingdom of Vidarbha, which was then split into itself and the neighboring and competing realm of Bhojakata."
 ###Palada
 palada_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mulaka"
 palada_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Palada come in abundance from Mulakan stock, a tribe descended from Mulaka, son of King Asmaka and those of his ancient realm. This tribe is situated at the confluence of several Indian groups of different regional and cultural diversity, and so they are at the center of a great many things. Perhaps this location will give them insight and importance."
 ###Karusa
 karusa_heritage:0 "Karusan Heritage"
 karusa_heritage_desc:0 "These people, from the time of the Mahabharata, have been known as fighters and glorious warriors. While they traveled many miles and laid down many settlements from the Vedic period to the time of Alexander, their most traditional and well-kept home was in the south, east of the Cedi tribe and west of the Kaimur hills. The Karusha trace their line back to the king Dantavakra, who supported Shishupala of the Chedi and was slain by Vasudeva Krishna when the polity of Karusha was one of the Yadava kingdoms."
 ###Indravana
 indravana_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Rich Sage Sisters"
 indravana_heritage_desc:0 "Tucked into the wild jungle, this region is surprisingly rich in gemstones and other precious commodities. The land itself is difficult to conquer and even Maurya hesitates before forming invasion plans, with the thickest and most impregnable jungle on either side of the region. The Saora, or Savana, people who lived there embrace a shamanistic culture within the Vedic faith, and isolate themselves in the practice of endogamy."
 ###Pitinika
 pitinika_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Generous"
 pitinika_heritage_desc:0 "The land of Pitinika, home to the Maharashtra people and the Marathi speakers, existed as a land on the edge, a land on the border between the Indian subcontinent and the ocean where they traveled far away to the mysterious lands of Persians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Much of the region is spotted with hills and low mountains, and few places are favorable to farming, yet the people persist, relying on the glory of their Yadava kingdom-legacy and the legendary king Singhani and his great generosity and donations."
 ###Alupa
 alupa_heritage:0 "Heritage the Ruling Serpents"
 alupa_heritage_desc:0 "The Alupan people are, in their tongue, the ones who rule, and their name, a possible corruption of Aluka, may derive from the epithet of the same name belonging to the mythological serpent Shesha. Similarly, the term may have referred to the nagas, a half-human and half-serpent race. The kingdom has had ambitions encompassing a large swath of the coast and has historical rulership over much of it. Perhaps these ambitions may find fulfillment…"
 ###Ashmaka
 ashmaka_heritage:0 "Ashmakan Heritage"
 ashmaka_heritage_desc:0 "One of the southernmost Mahajanapadas, great kingdoms, yet it suffered conquest at the hands of the Nandas dynasty within the fifth and fourth century BCE. While their location separates them from the chaos of the northern Indian plains and the chaos which Maurya brings on, they maintained communication and trade with dynasties as far north as those of Kalinga. With a great plain running through it, Ashmaka benefitted from higher food yields as well as more habitable terrain."
 ###Kuntala
 kuntala_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Nagas"
 kuntala_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting on the western Deccan, the kingdom of Kuntala dates back to the times of the Mahabharata, when king Chandrahasa sent his sons with the famed Arjuna on two military campaigns. The Yadavas of Devagiri note that the half-human, half-serpent Nagas were the first rulers of the kingdom and its people, perhaps mythologically connected to the great, plain-like wetlands fed by the many river branches flowing through it."
 ###Andhra
 andhra_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Villainous Mercenaries"
 andhra_heritage_desc:0 "Mentioned as a southern kingdom in the Mahabharata, the Andhra people served as warriors, perhaps mercenaries, in the armies of other kingdoms as fierce warriors. It was defeated alongside its allies by the might of the Sahadeva kingdom. They were deemed by victors to have been a people committing evil deeds and terribly fierce acts, as were many of their allies."
 ###Satiyaputa
 satiyaputa_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mousopalle"
 satiyaputa_heritage_desc:0 "This place is known through Ptolemy, who names the port and important location of the city of Mousopalle. Ruled by a Tamil elite, the country is set up to be at odds with itself, the ruling class against the largely Alupan-like peasants. Its trade outside the Indian landmass provided an outlet for cultural exploration while stabilizing the economy with an in-flow of goods."
 ###Mahisha
 mahisha_heritage:0 "Heritage of Demon Bull"
 mahisha_heritage_desc:0 "Mentioned as one of the southern kingdoms in the Mahabharata, the name of Mahisha means great or powerful. When fighting the army or Arjuna, the Mahishakas were considered fierce and formidable. Perhaps this is because the Mahishakas are said to be the descendants of king Mahishasura, a deceitful god/demon, specifically a buffalo demon."
 ###Adagaiman
 adagaiman_heritage:0 "Adagaiman Heritage"
 adagaiman_heritage_desc:0 "Adagaiman is home to Tamil peoples, yet sits in between the greater Tamil powers of Chola, Chera, and Pandya. Perhaps the inhabitants of Adagaiman were the result of emigration from the centralized kingdoms, rejects from those societies who fused together to create a homogenous buffer state situated in the hilltops found amidst the thick southern jungle. At their north is the southern end of the Deccan plateau and they are far from the desirable shore, instead relying on the many waterways crisscrossing their lands. Perhaps they will come down from their high place and seek to conquer greener pastures…"
 ###Kosar
 kosar_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Truthful"
 kosar_heritage_desc:0 "Mentioned in Tamil literature, the Kosars were a people known for being true to their king, being called ‘Vai-mazhi-Kosar’ or ‘truthful in keeping their words.’ This does not, however, mean that they did not seek out alliances and serve in other armies. They would serve under other Tamil kings as mercenaries and friends, and instead of seeing the great Maurya to the north as a fearsome antagonist, they saw a powerful ally and protector for their small domain."
 ###Parambu
 parambu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Velir"
 parambu_heritage_desc:0 "Originally hailing from the city of Tuvarapati, eighteen clans of the Velir were led by the legendary sage Agastya and eventually broke up into many groups settling all over India. A large regiment of these settled Parambu. Here, they had a simple and isolated life, stuck between the greater Tamil powers which wielded great power in the southern portion of the landmass. Perhaps if they collect the remnants of their widespread ancestors they may become the power in the region…"
 ###Malaya
 malaya_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kingdom of Dakkinadesa"
 malaya_heritage_desc:0 "Situated on the western portion of its corresponding isle, the people of Malaya were granted the ability to participate in the Erythraean trade which transported goods to the wide west. Notable for their gems and especially pearls, this place grew rich off of exports. These people traced their line back to the legendary Vijaya, founder of the Sinhalese peoples, and his grandson, Panduwas Deva, who settled the lands of Maya Rata. Panduwas Deva took care to mold his realm, building large structures and training a spectacular army."
 ###Ruhunu
 ruhunu_heritage:0 "Heritage of Murdered Mahanaga"
 ruhunu_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting on the eastern-facing side of its island, the kingdom of Ruhunu was the center of economic and cultural growth before the late domination of the kingdom of Anuradhapura (to which it at times served as a client state). The founder of the kingdom, Mahanaga, had been the one of the sons of the Anuradhapuran king Mutasiva but had left to form his own joint kingdom before his turn to rule came - he was murdered by Ramadatta, the mother of the prince, before he could take his rightful inheritance. Further threats were always presented by the mainland, with the three great Tamil dynasties eyeing the island for themselves. Thus, controlling the waters was essential."

## Black Sea Heritages
 ###Olbia
 olbia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Happy"
 olbia_heritage_desc:0 "A Milesian colony dating back to the 7th Century BCE, Olbia, or “the happy,” was an important convergence point for Scythian and Greek culture, with much attic pottery and Hellenic beliefs entering the semi-nomadic sphere through this port. It is said that the king of the Royal Scythians, Scyles, participated in the Bacchic rites in this town, owning his own home there, and was killed by his people for such a drastic acceptance of Greek culture. It is likely that the town began as the smaller island or peninsula-settlement of Berezan, but later grew with commercial and cultural importance. In the times of Alexander the Great, Olbia coordinated with Miletus against the Macedonian general Zopyrius."

 tyras_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Miletus around 600 BCE, Tyras and its sister-city Nikonion sat at the mouth of the navigable Tyras river and had tribal neighbors in the form of the Carpii and the Tyrgetae. The kings of the Royal Scythians, such as Scyles, had power and influence over these towns, as coins have been found in Nikonion which were minted with images and names of these semi-nomadic royals."
 ###Tyragetae
 tyragetae_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Island Tribesmen"
 tyragetae_heritage_desc:0 "A subtribe of the Getae, named such for living along the river Tyras, the Tyragetae often came into relations with both their similar tribal neighbors and the Greek cities and emporia lining the western coast of the Pontos Euxinos. What was notable about this group was that they held a significant presence, perhaps a central settlement or fortress, on an island found in the path of the Tyras itself."
 ###Getia
 getia_heritage:0 "Confusing Heritage"
 getia_heritage_desc:0 "These were a mysterious people, related and like in-customs to both Thracian and Dacian tribes, for they were neighbors to both, straddling the great Istros river which empties into the Pontus Euxinos but finds its source deep within the hinterlands of the tribal world. They have found themselves under the thumb of more powerful peoples, such as both the Royal Scythians and the Odrysian Kingdom. Yet, they retained their uniquely mixed identity and worked well alongside the Greek colonies they found themselves near. In 313 BCE, they aligned themselves with the cities of Kallatis and Odessos, and others, against the northern military expansions of Lysimachus. Famed for their cavalry squadrons, they served well in the service of foreign armies."
 ###Orgame
 orgame_heritage:0 "Heritage of Orgame"
 orgame_heritage_desc:0 "The oldest Greek colony in the modern region of Romania, Orgame predated its nearby neighbor city, the famous Histria, by at least a generation with its founding dated back to the 7th century BCE. However, the site has been clearly inhabited, at least loosely, since the Bronze Age period. It is said that Jason and the Argonauts rested here for a time before continuing on their way back to the Greek world with the Golden Fleece in tow."
 ###Istros
 istros_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Istros"
 istros_heritage_desc:0 "A Milesian colony founded soon after 650 BCE, ‘Istros’ or ‘Histria’ or ‘Histriopolis’ was founded for the purpose of trade with the Getae and the other native tribes which inhabited the vast and forested hinterlands. Set along the major river of the same name, the Istros, it controlled ship and travel access up and down the river. Taking up a space of about 60 hectares of land, the sizable coastal city held Apollo Iatros, Zeus, and Aphrodita as its main deities while it was led by an oligarchy made of representatives of all six Milesian tribes. While the town was nearly destroyed during the Scythian campaign of Darius in 512 BCE, it held deep ties with the nomadic world on account of foreign royal marriages. It was badly damaged again in the war between the Scythian king Ateas and king Phillip II, losing their protective walls around the city and acropolis around 339 BC. It was one of the Pontic towns that rebelled against Lysimachus from 313 to 309 BC, getting into a war with Byzantion over Tomis as well. Above all other pontic settlements of Milesian stock, Histria held a level of respect and reverence."
 ###Tomis
 tomis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Hero Visitors"
 tomis_heritage_desc:0 "Founded around the year 600 BCE, Tomis was the oldest continuously-inhabited settlement area located in the Scythia Minor region, or the coast of modern Romania. Some say the city itself was built by Queen Tomyris of the Massagetae following her triumph over Cyrus the Great of Persia, but it has also been said that this port was one which Jason and his companion argonauts visited on their return from capturing the Golden Fleece. Tomis conducted trade with Dacian, Thracian, and Getae groups, sending wine and luxury items inland. The town was a desired vassal of Byzantion for the purpose of northern trade, but Istros and Kallatis repelled Byzantine expeditions."
 ###Kallatis
 kallatis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kallatis"
 kallatis_heritage_desc:0 "A colony of Heraclea Pontica founded in the 6th century BCE, Kallatis was a trade-oriented port which largely survived the massive campaigns of Greeks and tribes such as the Scythians, such as the conquests of Scythian king Ateas without much impact on the city itself. Its period of wealth and increasing popularity may have come halfway through the 4th century BCE, when it began minting its own coins in 350 BCE. It was only after the question of Greek or tribal rule had been settled on the Pontos Euxinos when Kallatis revolted against Lysimachus during his northern expansion expeditions and got involved in a war with Byzantion over the partisanship of the neighboring port of Tomis."
 ###Krounoi
 krounoi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Founts of Water"
 krounoi_heritage_desc:0 "Set on a naturally fortified location, the settlement of Krounoi was at first a Thracian-settled town in the 5th century BCE. Yet, it was the Ionians who came and refounded this bastion of a city, naming it ‘Krounoi’ for the natural founts of water which surrounded it. Yet, when a statue depicting Dionysus was discovered poking out from beneath the waves of the sea, it was then called Dionysopolis. The name of Matiopolis was also given to this place for a time. These names all represented a great fort-city on the coast of a sea which was once considered inhospitable."
 ###Odessos
 odessos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Odessos"
 odessos_heritage_desc:0 "This place has been the home of rich elites and their burials since the Chalcolithic period. The Thracians had built a trading hub here, working bronzes and bargaining goods with people of Thessaly, the Caucasus, and greater Anatolia - these Thracians, whose tribe some call the Crobises, came into alliances and agreements with the powerful elites of the Odrysians and the Getae. The Milesians first arrived in the early 6th century BCE and set up an ‘apoikia,’ or trading post, in this rich and well-navigated area around the Thracians. It was a leading member of the Pontic Pentapolis of other Greek city states on the western coast of the sea, and it joined the Delian League by 425 BCE. After repelling the siege of Phillip II of Macedon in 339 BCE, it eventually fell to his son Alexander, and was thereafter inherited by Lysimachus - Odessos was an active member in the widespread revolt against Lysimachus, but became a submissive strongholds of the Greek ruler following the end of the rebellion."
 ###Mesembria
 mesembria_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mixed Greeks"
 mesembria_heritage_desc:0 "Set at the foot of mount Haemus, Mesembria (which may have once been called Menebria after its founder Menas, though some say the name was Melsembria first after a founder of the name Melsas) was a colony of many Greeks. Founded by Megara, Chalcedon or Byzantion or a mix of each of these over the years in the 6th century BCE, Mesembria was the only Dorian-dominant Greek city on the Thracian coast. Soon after it was founded it became a staunch rival of neighboring Apollonia in wealth, power, and trading routes and partners, minting its own coins in bronze and silver as early as the 5th century BCE. Mesembria joined the Delian League some time between 425 and 424 BCE. While it maintained a strong Hellenic culture, revering Apollo at a central temple within the city, its local history can be found in the Thracian fortifications the Greek walls were built around."
 ###Apollonia Pontica
 apollonia_pontica_heritage:0 "Heritage of Glorious Apollo"
 apollonia_pontica_heritage_desc:0 "First named Antheia at its founding in the 7th century BCE, the Phocaeans and Milesians who settled it quickly came to call it at times Apollonia Pontica and Apollonia Magna on account of an important temple to Apollo. In fact, there were temples dedicated to Apollo in the city, one late Archaic temple and another early Classical temple, both for Apollo Iatros. In the 5th century BCE, the city erected a colossal statue of Apollo, 13m tall, which stood as a visual dedication to the god of light, healing, and song. It was one of the most powerful cities of coastal Thrakia, as it had a treaty with the Odrysians granting them free trade. Because of its liberal trading, it was a strong competitor and rival of neighboring the colony of Mesembria. This city managed to keep its independence from Alexander, Phillip and Lysimachus, being the only Greek city on the western coast of the Pontos Euxinos to do so."
 ###Crobyzia
 crobyzia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Armorless"
 crobyzia_heritage_desc:0 "A Thracian tribe sitting alongside the great Istros river, opposite of the wily Getae, the Krobyzoi were a northern group in the Thracian sphere who had to deal with dangerous neighbors in their own creative ways. To their west were the ferocious Triballi and south of them were the Odrysians, whom all Thracians knew as hegemonic rulers within their culture. Strangely, the Krobyzoi were said to have worn no armor, at the most bearing a felt cap or the hat of some other design."

## Helladic Heritages
 ###Serdia
 serdia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Serdia"
 serdia_heritage_desc:0 "The Serdi tribe was likely one of the many Celtic groups which migrated into the north helladic region some time in the 4th century BCE during the celtic migrations. However, this tribe also exhibited Thracian qualities which may betray a mixed origin or a rather quick acculturation of some Thracian elements. Pressured by dangerous native Thracian tribes such as the Triballi and the Odrysians, these people are constantly pressured either to secure the perimeters of their territory or embark on yet another migration to weaker lands - all eyes look south towards a corrupt and weakening Macedon."
 ###Maedia
 maedia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Maedia"
 maedia_heritage_desc:0 "A Thracian tribe established on the Strymon river in the borderlands of Paeonia, the Maedi were a fiercely independent (as so recognized by the Odrysian king Sitalkes) and very rebellious tribe who fought against both Philip II and Alexander of Macedon. While the Maedi were well protected in their home with deep gorges and cliffsides, there remained many pressures on their safety from the burgeoning and constantly shifting populations to the north. The newly migrated celts and more powerful tribes gave good reason to look south for new and attainable lands… perhaps in Greece."
 ###Paeonia
 paeonia_heritage:0 "Paeonian Heritage"
 paeonia_heritage_desc:0 "An old people with a mix of Illyrian, Thracian and Hellenic origin, the Paeonians once held a great swath of land stretching from the Propontis to their current lands. They say they were descended all and all from the Elean prince Paeon, son of the Aeolian shepherd Endymion. They were also famously allies of the Trojans in the great war at Ilion in the age of heroes. Following a slow decline, their level of wide control was destroyed by the invasion of Darius, after which the Paeonians were relegated to their mountain-outlined homelands. Folly struck again with the expansion of the Macedonians throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, when they came under the subjugation of Philip II. Walking further along their Hellenic heritage, they embraced the gifts of the god Dionysus, whom they knew to be called Dyalus or, equally, Dryalus, whom they maintained a strong cult for in their mountainous home."
 ###Cavia
 cavia_heritage:0 "Cavian Heritage"
 cavia_heritage_desc:0 "Living around the ancient lake Scutari which is fed by karstic springs, the Cavii were a well-provided-for tribe among the Illyrians. Settling the majority of themselves in their capital of Epicaria, also known as Durnium, they were close to the northern groups of the Taulanti tribesmen who inhabited the coastline and held much power in the region. Many raids and expeditions had been sent by Taulantian kings and warlords against the Cavii and their similarly-sized neighbors, yet they maintained their ground and protected their native lake-settlement."
 ###Apollonia
 apollonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Xenophobic Guests"
 apollonia_heritage_desc:0 "The biggest and most populous of the Greek colonies in Illyria, Apollonia was of Corinthian and possibly also Korkyran origin which was settled around 600 BCE. It is said that these Greeks were invited by the native Illyrians to live there and create a great trading station in a place which was then largely abandoned. Originally named Gylakeia, which may have derived from a local tyrant of the name Gylax, after the Corinthian influence fell the town was refounded as Apollonia in reverence to Apollo like all the other Classical towns called ‘Apollonia.’ The Corinthians, while they controlled the city, largely focused on resource extraction in order to support the home city and its growing population, but Apollonia soon gained its own independence under an Oligarchic order where Greek colonial elites ruled over an Illyrian-dominant population. The citystate pursued a xenophobic policy, similar to that of the Spartans, even while it established good relations with nearby tribes like the Taulantii."
 ###Korkyra
 korkyra_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Phaeacians"
 korkyra_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that this island takes its name from the naiad called Korkyra, who was a daughter of the Asopos river and the nymph Metope who was herself daughter of the river-god Ladon. Poseidon fell in love with fair-haired Korkyra and stole her away to the then-unnamed island of scheria, offering her name to the place. Sailors looking on at the island with all its dark woods called it 'Korkyra the Black'. There, she and the god of the sea had a child named Phaiax, himself father of the king Alcinous whom Odysseus meets as well as that of all those called Phaiakes or Phaeacians. The Corinthians came to this long-forgotten island in the Archaic Period to set up a powerful colony for trade and naval control of the Illyrian coast. Yet, this colony would be famously rebellious and one of the earliest-recorded naval battles in history would occur between the island and its mother-city in the middle of the 7th century BCE. Korkyra similarly found itself in pivotal roles of following conflicts, as a ship-supplier in the Persian Wars and then as a major instigator of the Peloponnesian War on account of its conflict with Corinth over the state of the Illyrian colony called Epidamnos. The island would also change hands many times, being briefly occupied by the Spartans in 303 BCE then assaulted by Cassander of Macedon but saved by the superior fleet of Agathocles of Syracuse, who promptly subjugated the island - Agathocles would not be the last."
 ###Ambracia
 ambracia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Democratic Loyalty"
 ambracia_heritage_desc:0 "Founded between 650 and 625 BCE by Gorgus, son of the Corinthian tyrant called Cypselus, Ambracia began as a colony focused on resource production and exportation, sending out crop and fishery produce as well as timber for shipbuilding - much of this went to the Epirote elite. The tyrannical rule of the Gorgid line ended with his son Periander, who was ousted from power and replaced with a democratic-type government. Ambracia flourished as a loyal subject of Corinth because it not only strengthened ties to rich Epirus, but served as a mediator and counterbalance to the rebellious island colony of Korkyra in the north. Philip II subjugated the city in 338 BCE, but the Ambrakia maintained many traditional policies and values even under Diadochi occupation and control."
 ###Akarnania
 akarnania_heritage:0 "Heritage of Prosperous Revenge"
 akarnania_heritage_desc:0 "Acarnan, son of the Argive Epigoni member named Alcmaeon came to and founded Akarnania after avenging the murder of his father and after traveling on the advice of the river god Achelous - the settlers who joined them in this place came from the lands of Epirus. Homer knew not the lands of Akarnania, calling it only a land opposite of Ithaca, home of Odysseus, and part of Epirus at large. The Corinthians came to these lands and those around them in the 7th century, settling the land with colonists and pressuring the native members to move towards the interior. Thus, the Akarnanians joined together and established a capital for themselves at the side of the river Achelous called Stratos, which both involved itself in many great wars of the region and also prospered in its economy."
 ###Patrai
 patrai_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Farmer Patreus"
 patrai_heritage_desc:0 "Found in the shadow of Mount Panachaiko, settlement of the Patras area has its origin in the Bronze Age, specifically in the 3rd Millennium BCE. However, it came to local prominence after the height of the Mycenaean period had ended, in the later half of the 2nd millennium BCE, when three neighboring settlements of Aroi, Antheia, and Mesatis combined their political organization into one central elite system. This combination has been attributed to the legendary figure of Patreus, son of Preugenes in the line of Spartan Lacedaemon, who supposedly created Patras as a colony meant to support the growing populations of the Peloponnese. Thus, Patras remained a farming city through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic period which supplied its neighbors and subjugators."
 ###Amphissa
 amphissa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ozolian Locrians"
 amphissa_heritage_desc:0 "The most important city for the Ozolian Locrians, Amphissa took its name from a Locrian woman of the same name, that same ‘Issa’ who was granddaughter of wind-lord Aeolus and daughter to incestuous Macareus. It is said Apollo catered her love while in the form of a shepherd and far-seeing Arachne wove the image of their affair into her weaving. The town had prospered since Mycenaean times, and continued to build great tombs and temples honoring both their legendary ancestors and gods such as Asclepius and possibly the chthonic Cabeiri, who, among others, were called “anaktes boys.” The city became a great center of commerce and culture, building great relations with nearby Corinth and the lesser towns of Locris, forging its unique identity with its own calendar and its status as a colonizing power with settlers sailing off to southern Italy. A stronghold in its region, Amphissa guaranteed safety for troops during the Persian assaults on Greece and was also a formidable opponent in both the Corinthian War and the Third Sacred War. While Philip II of Macedon finally destroyed the greatness of Amphissa along with its physical structures, the city was able to rebuild its glory and began competing in more localized conflicts, such as those against its Aetolian neighbors."
 ###Elatea
 elatea_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Oetan Gateway"
 elatea_heritage_desc:0 "First and foremost, Elateia was a supreme military post, for, while it resided on a fertile basin beside the river which hosted the local god Cephissus, it served best as a defensible place from which to separate southern Greece from the pass which came down from Mount Oeta. The Elateians claimed to be of Arcadian stock, being sons and daughters of Elatus, himself a son of Peloponnesian Arcas - to Elatus there yet exists a stelae in the marketplace bearing his name and image in reverence. However, this stelae barely survived the mass-burning the army of Xerxes committed to Phocian lands during his invasion, and the citizens had to wait for Philip II of Macedon to take control of the region before fortifications were renewed. Yet, its resurgence alarmed southern Greece, which regarded it as both a wall and a doorway through which invaders may come."
 ###Oreos
 oreos_heritage:0 "A Heritage Rich in Grapes"
 oreos_heritage_desc:0 "Set at the foot of Mount Telethrium, Oreos, once called Histiaia or Histiaea, controlled the northern region of the Euboean island and gave this region the name Histiaeotis. It is unknown who truly built this strategic city, be it the Perrhaebi of Thessaly, Attic settlers, or the daughter so named Histiaea, whom Hyrieus of Boeotia fathered. One of the most ancient Euboean cities, it is listed in the Catalogue of Ships found in Book 2 of the Iliad, which sent ships to far-off Troy. The city itself sat across from Antron on the Thessalian coast and controlled the passage of ships into and out of the waterways between the island and the mainland. Perhaps this is why it is reported that the city had two citadels with one guarding the city center and another looming over the sea itself. For its strategic and wealthy position, the city and its elite members became game pieces in the politics of stronger powers such as Athens and Macedon."
 ###Opus
 opus_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Opuntian Locrians"
 opus_heritage_desc:0 "Chief city of the Opuntian Locrians, Opus stood a mere 15 stadia away from the shore of the so-called Opuntian Gulf which saw ships of commerce and war travel its waters from the mainland to the island of Euboea and to the greater Aegean Sea. Many Greeks, including Theban Pindar, even believed this town to be one of the earliest in all Greece, having been settled by the same legendary Opus who was the son of Locrus and Protogeneia, each descendants of Deucalion who was the great survivor of the world-flood. Some say Opus was the residing place of famed Deucalion and his wife Phyrrha after the waters subsided, and for this reason it became a spawning ground for more figures of legendary report. The companion of Phthiotian Achilles, Patroclus, called it his native city, and its troops were led by Little Ajax, son of Oileus, king over all Locrians. For this reason, an altar to Little Ajax was built in Opus and the Aiantea games were held to honor him. The Opuntians found glory even after the Age of Heroes and the Trojan War, because the brave men of this place fought alongside the Spartans at Thermopylae against the onslaught of the Persian army Xerxes sent against Greece."
 ###Tanagra
 tanagra_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Greek"
 tanagra_heritage_desc:0 "An old Boeotian town set on the fertile bank of the river Asopus, ancient writers believed this place to be the Graea mentioned by Homer, home to the Boeotian Graikoi tribe from whom came the latin ‘Graecus’ or ‘Greek.’ Yet, while this town may have given rise to the term representative of all Greeks, its first inhabitants were supposedly Phoenicians who came over with Cadmus of Thebes. It was at least by the time of the Trojan war that the city had a Greek nature, fielding the hero called Poimandros, who some claim founded or re-founded the place as Poimandria in his own name, but the name can also refer to the many surrounding meadows which made for a peaceful landscape - a peace the city could not hide in. Its proximity to Athens drew it into several conflicts, including the titular war between the merchant empire and Sparta. The lands of Tanagra were the site of two major battles in the Peloponnesian War, where the locals saw both strategic victory and defeat but defeat in all, for their fertile lands were captured, pillaged, and used as battlefields for vast armies. Perhaps this experience encompassed the Greek experience at large, and serves to validate their ancient name. Yet, like with all Greeks, culture was made to shine through even the darkest din of battle, and the Tanagra figurines lasted as beautiful and emotional images of real men, women, and children of the age which their descendants could look upon for guidance and assurance."
 ###Troizen
 troizen_heritage:0 "Heritage of Theseus` Legacy"
 troizen_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that Pittheus, the most pious son of Tantalian Pelops and both the grandfather and teacher of mighty Theseus, formed the city of Troezen by uniting the sister towns of Hyperea and Antheia which could be found along the shore of the Saronic Gulf. For the name of his creation  he gave the same name of his deceased brother. And in his new city, the hero Theseus was born to Aethra, and in that same city Theseus proved himself when he lifted the great boulder which had pinned down the sword and sandals of Aegeus. Yet, for all its glory, the city was witness to equal sorrow and disgrace. Within its walls, the Cretan Phaedra came to love her stepson Hippolytus, and, in her folly, caused his demise at the edge of the city limits. In memory of this sad occurrence, girls of Troezen, before they were married, dedicated a lock of their hair to the boy who had been unjustly felled. Perhaps the only pure spot the town retained was the ancient spring the horse Pegasus had made with his wings when coming to ground."
 ###Hermione
 hermione_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Dryopes"
 hermione_heritage_desc:0 "A town at the extremity of the Argolid region, Hermione retained enough independence and control through its own powers and the distance from other important city-states such as Argos or Corinth that the sea between itself and the island of Hydra was known as the Hermionitic Gulf. It is said that the ancient Dryopes founded this town, who themselves once resided on and around Mount Oeta but migrated south and west out of their home region called Dryopis long before the Dorian Greeks came to rule in their place and with the authority of the Dorian dialect. Thereafter one of the longest lasting in its independence and cultural tradition, Hermione became the greatest of the remaining cities claimed by the Dryopes during the time of the Trojan war and even after the Epics Homer gives accounts of. Its importance even swelled outside the realm of the culture and the memory of the Dryopes, however, when Hermione became the first and foremost member of the Southern Amphictyony which held its meetings on the nearby island of Calaureia. Yet, even their long-lasting power and importance fell along with the rest of the relics of the ancient times, as mighty Argos came into control of Hermione as well as Mycenae and Tiryns around 464 BCE. Even under this subjugation and that of others, the people retained their Dyropian ancestry and maintained worship of the chief god of the Dryopes, Demeter Chthonia, who feeds the soil and brings bounty to the land."
 ###Pellene
 pellene_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Giant Pallas"
 pellene_heritage_desc:0 "Most easterly of the Achaean cities, the people of Pellene traced their origins back to the great giant Pallas, the skin of whom became a cover for the shield of Athena after he had been flayed alive after the conclusion of the Gigantomachy. Perhaps that is why the city could be found straddling a great hill 60 stadia from the sea, with an unreachable peak bisecting its whole length. The men and women of Pellene, however, also held a human origin for their part, recalling the story of Phorbas, sixth king of powerful Argos, and his son, Argive Pellen, who fled his homeland with a great squadron of colonists and builders to found his own legacy in the north of the Peloponnese. Thus, these people had an ancient history, and were therefore recorded in the Catalogue of Ships Homer provides for the war-party which sailed to Troy all those years ago. It is known that the city therefore prospered and grew, for the people living in far-off Scione in the Macedonian peninsula of Pellene claimed to be originally of that place, having settled there on the return from war-torn Troy. From that ancient point on, Pellene produced many strong athletes good in competition, and such an athlete as Chaeron would champion the city as its tyrant with aid from Alexander the Great."
 ###Aigion
 aigion_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Athletes"
 aigion_heritage_desc:0 "Before the city, there was a long history of neolithic settlement here, but the city did eventually rise during the era of Homer and the telling of the Epics. Since 800 BCE Aigion has stood as an Achaean bulwark and was a member of the first Achaean League. It produced many hero-athletes, such a Xenophon the Elder who won the 100th Olympic Games, Ladas the victor in the 125th Olympic stadion race, Athenodorus who won the stadion race in the Olympics no less than three times, and Straton who was victor of the dangerous pankration and wrestling matches. The city, like its chief athletes, took advantage of the weakness of its opponents, and, after an earthquake and tsunami destroyed neighboring Helike in 373 BCE, Aigion swallowed the undefended tract of land. The kings of Macedon came to control this place in 330 BCE."
 ###Dyme
 dyme_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Athletic Curse"
 dyme_heritage_desc:0 "Set on the northwestern Achaean coast, 30 stadia from the river Larisus, which separates it from the territory of Elis, and 60 stadia from the promontory as well as the cape called Araxos, the city of Dyme was no stranger to the sea and the waters which fed it. Perhaps these waterways gave entry to the exiled tribe of Anatolian Caucones, whom many Greeks claimed came to live at that place after leaving their homeland. Again, this town provided shelter to sailors and survivors of at least one great battle of the Peloponnesian War which was waged on the nearby waters. Yet, for all its helpful good deeds, the city is best known for its ancient athlete by the name of Oebotas, who won the stadion race of the sixth Olympics in 756 BCE. When this man was not honored for his victory, he cursed defeat and dishonor on all Achaeans and their athletes, a curse which would hold until the Achaeans built a statue dedicated to him and Sostratus of Pellene was able to win the foot race for boys."
 ###Azania
 azania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Singing Fish"
 azania_heritage_desc:0 "A place of wonder, the region of Arcadian Azania has been a curious set of lands for endless time, ruled by the eponymous Azan, himself son of king Arcas of all Arcadia and the nymph Erato. It was his son, Cleitor, who is said to have ventured off to settle his own home and city, which he swiftly named after himself in the pattern of tradition. Found with the Aroanian Mountains at its back and the Aroanius and then Ladon river before it, Cleitor held a particularly beautiful and peculiar natural spot. It was famous for its Cleitorian Fountain, one of the curiosities of Azania, which is said to have removed the taste for wine from all who drank its waters. This fountain has been described as a spring which sprouts out of the hillside itself, and is claimed to have been used for the purpose of ritual purification, such as in the case of the daughters of Proteus. Besides the magical waters, the place was home to creatures which visitors claimed were “singing fish,” those which dwelled in the river Aroanius. Their voices were like that of thrushes. With all this wondrous landscape to surround them, it is no surprise then that the people of Cleitor and, in fact, all Azania, championed liberty and personal freedom over all other things."
 ###Stymphalia
 stymphalia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Stymphalian Birds"
 stymphalia_heritage_desc:0 "Herakles came to this place in order to slay the Stymphalian Birds in completing the sixth of his Twelve Labors. These man-eating birds, which lived in the marshes of Stymphalia for protection against wolves, each had a bronze beak and sharp metallic feathers. The birds which survived his onslaught fled to the island of Aretias for safety. Some say that these birds were no birds at all, but were women, young girls of king Stymphalus and Ornis, from the town itself who Herakles had killed in retaliation for their lack of hospitality. Thus, the mother of Herakles, cow-eyed Hera, was venerated in this city in the form of the maiden, the matron, and the widow. Yet, Brauronian Artemis was the chief deity of the town, whom they shared with the Athenians of the same cult."
 ###Mantinea
 mantinea_heritage:0 "Heritage of Water-Engineering"
 mantinea_heritage_desc:0 "The product of several neighboring villages merging into a singular, superior, political identity, Mantinea came to be around the year 500 BCE with the god of the sea, Lord Poseidon, as its patron. Besides the trident-god there were many temples within the city-walls. Artemis Hymnia from general Arcadian worship had her place there - Diotima whom Socrates befriended (and mentioned in the Symposium) held the station of priestess there. Yet, the greatest fixture of the town was the dam of Manitnea, a great marvel of ancient Greek engineering. Beyond these grand establishments of civilization, the legacy of mantinea was death and dread. It was the site of the largest land battle of the Peloponnesian War in 418 BCE. The city was later dismantled into small villages by the Spartan rulers under the agreements of the Peace of Antalcidas of 387 BCE. The Second Battle of Mantinea likewise saw the defeat of the Theban army and the hegemony of that city in 362 BCE. In all this time, the Mantineans practiced a unique form of democracy where officials would have been voted in not by popular vote but by the will of a special committee which the people voted for. When a part of the Arcadian League in 360 BCE, this democratic practice was supported by the fellow league members, as opposed to when Mentinea found itself under the Spartan thumb."
 ###Tegea
 tegea_heritage:0 "Heritage of Fatal Mistakes"
 tegea_heritage_desc:0 "One of the oldest and most powerful cities in ancient Arcadia, Tegea was settled by Tegeates, son of Lycaon who was king over all of Arcadia. Tegeates and his city learned sorry when his son Leimon killed his other son Scephrus out of fear for the wrath of Apollo, for which he himself was subsequently shot by Artemis. The other sons fled for Crete, founding new cities there, while Tegeates was left to mourn his children and began a tradition of instituted rites for Scephrus performed during the festival of Apollo Agyieus where a priestess of Artemis would chase a young man of the town like Artemis pursued Leimon. Afterwards, the city came to have a unique relationship with powerful Sparta, wherein the Tegean army would be at the disposal of the Laconians, but their politics would remain independent. This tense relationship fluctuated as time passed, and Tegea did at times walk the warpath to guarantee its safety."
 ###Heraia
 heraia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Myrtles"
 heraia_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Heraeus, son of the Arcadian king Lycaon, the city of Heraea was once called Sologorgus. These early city-goers, because they lived in the valley of the Alpheius river so close to the sacred, wooded lands of Elis, crafted a treaty with the Eleians which was intended to bring peace between them and mutual defense for a century. This came from the time of the 50th Olympiad, or around 580 BCE when the Eleians held a dominant position in the region. The Laconians say that it was the Spartan king Cleombrotus I who founded the city, bringing together at least eight neighboring villages into one polity. For this strong tie to the belligerent Spartans, the Heraeans gained the eye of scrutiny from their Arcadian brethren and sister-cities, who took to destroying their lands in 370 BCE. To prevent this from becoming a seasonal occurrence, the Heraeans made the effort to join at times the Achaean League and the Aetolian League for their own safety and mutual protection, as had once been done with the Eleians. They had much fertile land and valuables to keep safe, including their great myrtle plantations which, when in bloom, lit up the fields in a beautiful screen of color."
 ###Lepreon
 lepreon_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Blessed Leprosy"
 lepreon_heritage_desc:0 "Chief town of the Triphylia region, the stories of the founding of Lepreon are numerous and diverse. Some say that the grandson of Poseidon, Lepreus, son of Pyrgeus, came to create the city - this is the same Lepreus who, after losing in many friendly contests, challenged the hero Herakles to duel and was soundly defeated. Because it has been said that this Lepreus was of the Caucones tribe, which had been expelled from Anatolia and had come to Hellas swiftly to settle lands there, that this city was also to be considered a Minyan city, for the Minyans are said to have driven the Caucones out of the lands they settled and to have settled those lands themselves in the name of the great Minyas. Yet, others offer that the name of the town is far more simple than these tales, but also distasteful, coming from the fact that at one time there was a great wave of leprosy which affected the people who lived there, and so it was named in memory of the affliction. In either case, people have lived in this place since the Neolithic period, using its bounty of natural resources to sustain themselves. These natural landscapes also came to hold religious importance, as there was a sacred grove in the land which was special to Dione, sometimes considered the female counterpart to almighty Zeus and other times considered the embodiment of women in the world. To many, this stretch of fertile and defensible land was considered the “blessed country.”"
 ###Megalopolis
 megalopolis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Size"
 megalopolis_heritage_desc:0 "Built up on both banks of the river Elisson, the ‘mega’ in Megalopolis was quite justified. It was the largest urbanized area within the Arcadian region and boasted many great buildings including a theater which could hold 20,000 people. Likewise, the Thersileon with its 67 pillars and a temple stood out among the cityscape as a marvel to behold. The city was actually refounded in 317 BCE overtop a previous town also called Megalopolis, and so there is a deep-seated understanding of great events and people having changed the course of history around here. This is way many believed that Megalopolis and its surrounding lands were at least one major battlefield in the ancient Titanomachy, with the bones of titans littering the fields and the scorch-marks of the lightning bolts which Zeus tossed down dotting the landscape - fires even on occasion rebuilt themselves from the ground, emerging spontaneously from the rocky earth itself. Due to its size and the Arcadian support behind its stability, Megalopolis was set up as a counterbalance to the military might of hegemonic Sparta and became a valuable member of the Arcadian League."
 ###Polyrrhenia

 ###Kydonia
 kydonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kydones"
 kydonia_heritage_desc:0 "Legends disagree on the origin of this city, with the mainlanders championing the idea that the Arcadian prince Kydon established his namesake town after fleeing his home of Tegea with the rest of his remaining siblings after a great family tragedy. The Cretans, however, were convinced that it was old King Minos who made the city, for he controlled the whole island in his day. In either case, the settlement of Kydonia dates back to the Bronze Age, as its name is mentioned in linear-B tablets found in the administrative records of Knossos. The citadel of the harbor of Kydonia, however, tells a tale of Neolithic inhabitation and a civilized establishment in the Early Minoan Period. While Homer lists a Kydones tribe which, although not the same as naming the citizens of Kydonia, admits a knowledge of these people to have existed, yet Herodotus claims that the Samians built this place in 520 BCE and were only afterwards defeated by Cretans and Aeginetans. Even the early coins of the place match the patterns and style of those found in Aegina, confirming the economic, if not political, connection."
 ###Tarrha
 tarrha_heritage:0 "Heritage of Apollo Worship"
 tarrha_heritage_desc:0 "Situated between the Cretan sea and the Samaria Gorge, Tarrha was a creation of the Classical Period. The city also boasted the role of one of the earliest towns to exhibit worship of Apollo. A temple to the cult image of Apollo Tarrhaios was venerated there and so the site was an important center of worship not only on the Cretan island but in the Greek world, for Apollo was one of the oldest, most-cherish, and most-feared gods residing in Olympos. Off the coast lay the island of Gaudos, a dry, rocky, and relatively empty place. This may perhaps have been the island known to Homer and the ancients as Ogygia where the nymph Kalypso resided. Settlement on the island dates to Neolithic times, so its history runs quite deep, and rumors run rampant about strange and empty islands few ever attend…"
 ###Lappa
 lappa_heritage:0 "Heritage of Agamemnon`s Colony"
 lappa_heritage_desc:0 "An inland town, Lappa maintained access to both the northern and southern seas which brushed the borders of Crete. On the southern coast, it controlled the waters through the local port of Phoenix. There is a rumor that this city was a creation of Mycenaean Agamemnon and it was therefore named after a neighboring Tarrhan man called Lampos - some say this story serves only to ease the bruised prestige of this town on account of its having been a colony built by a larger neighbor of more import."
 ###Gortyna
 gortyna_heritage:0 "Heritage of Europa"
 gortyna_heritage_desc:0 "Once called Larissa or, at a time, Kremnia, Gortyna held a history and importance second only to Knossos on the island of Crete. It was on the Gortyn coast that Menelaus of Sparta smashed against a sharp reef with his ships on his return from Troy, which were shredded on the harsh surfaces - many of the crew were spared a terrible fate. It was here, too, that Zeus, disguised as a bull, stole away Europa from her Phoenician home and had one of his many affairs with her under the shade of a plane tree. She thus bore him Minos, Rhadamanthys, and Sarpedon, who all become the kings of Minos and retained an important role both on the battlefield and even after death - for Rhadamanthys governed the gateway of the dead. The name of Europa was thereafter used when referring to Hellas and the greater landmass it connects to, so it can be said that all of geographical and cultural Europa owes its origin to the isle of Crete and the land of Gortyna. Because it was nearly the equal of the great city of Knossos, but not wishing to fight and make both equally weak, Gortyna entered into an agreement with the old home of Minos wherein the two powers would work together to rule over all of Crete."
 ###Knossos
 knossos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Minotaur"
 knossos_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited as early as the Neolithic period, Knossos became the known center of the Minoan world and culture when it became a palace center in the early Middle Minoan Period around 2,000 BCE. While the palace underwent equal periods of growth, decadence, decay, destruction, and reconstruction, it was by-far the largest, most intricate, and most powerful palace on the island of Crete during its long reign over the Minoan sphere. Even after the time of its superiority had long passed, the Mycenaeans had conquered Crete, and Hellas became the center for the newly ‘Greek’ world, Knossos remained a wealthy and prosperous city close to the sea and still heavily-connected with the islands and ports which once made up its Thalassocracy. It is well-known that the son of Zeus and Europa, king Minos ruled here and created the great Minoan Empire which ruled the seas so totally as to not build walls at home. His palace was so complex that it gave rise to the myth of the Minotaur and the journey of Theseus to conquer the beast, with the double-axe labrys showing as its symbol of power."
 ###Eleutherna
 eleutherna_heritage:0 "Heritage of Eleutherna"
 eleutherna_heritage_desc:0 "Dorians colonized or at least came to power in this place during the ninth century BCE, long after the Minoans, Mycenaeans, and the great Bronze Age Collapse. This was a good place to set up a town because its steep local ridge provided a great deal of natural defense. A natural crossroads between Kydonia and Knossos, Eleutherna benefited from trading caravans and the luxury goods which entered Crete through those wealthy ports. However, the city did have its own ports of Stavromenos and Panormos on the shore to supply its own import needs."
 ###Arkades
 arkades_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Churning Land"
 arkades_heritage_desc:0 "The lands of Arkades, which some have also called Arcadia - not to be confused with the Arcadia of the Peloponnese - seem to have endured a harsh and churning history. It is said that the springs and the lakes of this area at once dried up and were spoiled when the city was destroyed and the cultivation of the land itself came to an end. The earth became hard and crumbled not under the downpour of the rains. Thus it was the farmhands and the work of the people which kept this land in a prosperous state. This was proven when, after they rebuilt the city, the cultivators returned to the land and the springs and lakes and bodies of water again populated the region. In another strange occurrence, against the beliefs of all its sister-cities, the people of Arkades could not believe that Mount Ida was the birthplace of almighty Zeus, and that it must have been some other sacred cave."
 ###Lyctus
 lyctus_heritage:0 "Heritage of Zeus` Birth"
 lyctus_heritage_desc:0 "One of the most substantial settlements on ancient Crete, the inhabitants of Lyctus claimed to be Spartan colonists who championed the worship of Apollo. Yet, the importance of the location can be traced back to the time of the Iliad with its mention in the Catalogue of Ships, but even before that. It is said in the Theogony that Rhea gave birth to Zeus here and hid him away in a cave of Mount Aegaeon. Its claim as one of the oldest Cretan cities can be verified by a mention under the name ‘Rikata’ in the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III. Linear-B texts similarly write the name as ‘Ru-ki-to.’ In 344 BCE the Phokians under Phalaecus aided Knossos in assaulting and capturing Lyctus, only to lose it to the Spartan king Archidamus."
 ###Ierapetra
 ierapetra_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Piratic Bride"
 ierapetra_heritage_desc:0 "Nicknamed “The Bride of the Libyan Sea” for its southern location on the island, Ierapetra remained a significant local power from the Minoan Period to the Hellenistic Age. Some say that the Anatolian Corybantes built this place, who were the armed and crested dancers venerating Phrygian Cybele. Still a competing neighbor of the island, the Ierapetrans committed themselves to piracy for the purpose of wealth and prestige in the warfare of raiding."
 ###Praesos
 praesos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the True Cretans"
 praesos_heritage_desc:0 "Nicknamed “The people of Praesos claimed to be the “eteokretans” or ‘True Cretans.’ They held a tradition which they say predated the Greeks themselves, and used a language with inscriptions from the 7th-3rd century BCE which itself may have been derived from the Minoan language of Linear-A. These were the so-called Cretan hieroglyphs. The city was home to the temple and cult of Dictaean Zeus, for Mount Dicte was in the neighboring territory. It has been inhabited since Neolithic times, but remained a well-stationed settlement through the Minoan, Mycenaean, and Greek periods. In keeping with its focus on Cretan heritage and the before-times, the Praesans believed the Antaolian Corybantes who colonized parts of Crete to have been the children of Athena and Helios."

## Sicilian Heritages
 ###Selinous
 selinous_heritage:0 "Heritage of Powerful Celery"
 selinous_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the 7th century BCE by the older Sicilian colony Megera Hyblaea under the guidance of a man called Pammilus and with the aid of colonists from the mother-city Megara back in Greece, Selinous was named on account of the batches of wild celery which grew in its local area - so the celery leaf became its image on coins. Being the westernmost Greek colony on the isle of Sicily, Selinous came into contact frequently with the Phoenicians and, later, the Carthaginians, but it was the local Elymians and Sikanoi whom they struggled against in conflicts over borders and control. It came to achieve great power through these conflicts and a constant growth supplied by Helladic colonists, and it achieved a dominance over the areas of the rivers Mazarus and Halycus. The city had its small role to play in staling and diminishing the effects of the failed Athenian Expedition during the Peloponnesian War, but Selinous later fell to the Carthaginians whom it had before attempted to aid in battle, succumbing to the great army of Hannibal Mago in 409 BCE."
 ###Herakleia Minoa
 herakleia_minoa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Double-Myth"
 herakleia_minoa_heritage_desc:0 "Each name of this city corresponded to a separate tale of its creation. For his part, Herakles was said to have vanquished the local Sicilian hero called Eryx here in a wrestling match - for defeating this king of the land, he earned for the Herakleidae the rights to populate the western half of the island. Likewise, it is said that Minos himself of Crete came to Sicily searching for Daedalus, who had escaped the Labyrinth, and founded a city at the mouth of the river Halycus where he first landed. The truth of the matter, however, was that the city held a much less prestigious origin, and was instead a colony of its western neighbor city Selinous, and was built in the 6th century BCE by settlers from that town. Thereafter, Herakleia Minoa remained in an eternal war of influence and control between its creator, Selinous, and its even more powerful neighbor to the east, Akragras, and even the Carthaginians who warred with all these cities."
 ###Gela
 gela_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tyrannical Wars"
 gela_heritage_desc:0 "Jointly founded by both Cretan and Rhodian colonists in the early 7th century BCE, Gela, named after the nearby river of the same name, was the city where the famed playwright Aeschylus died in 456 BCE. After its creation, this city became so large and prosperous, crowded even, that it is said colonists from this city founded the powerful town of Akragas to the west in the 6th century BCE. Under its tyrants Hippocrates and Gelon, Gela warred against many of its neighboring cities and at one point had conquered each of them, including powerful Syracuse. Their first great defeat and destruction was at the hands of the Carthaginians, after which they came into greater relations with the other Greek cities of Sicily."
 ###Siculia
 siculia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Forgotten Matriarchy"
 siculia_heritage_desc:0 "The largest of the three major native Italic tribes of Sicily and the givers of its known name, the Siculi melded into Greco-Roman culture rapidly due to the influence of the many Greek colonies along the coast of the island. However, their introduction into the Hellenic sphere occurred long before the time of Greek colonialism, because evidence has been found that the Bronze Age Mycenaeans came into conflict with this place. Perhaps Homer knew of this when he spoke in his Odyssey of the land of the Sicels. They originally held onto all the land of Sicily, but when the Greeks from Chalkis and other overcrowded cities came, their fate was chance. The Dorians, like many Hellenic groups, did not keep good relations with them and drove them from their advantageous ports into the wild hinterlands. Quickly, their unique cultures were lost, including the tradition of matriarchichal customs which dominated many of the tribes."
 ###Calactea
 calactea_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fair Shore"
 calactea_heritage_desc:0 "Upon returning from his paid exile to Corinth by Syracuse, Ducetius, leader of the former Sicel Empire in Sicily, founded the city of Kale Acte in 466 BCE - better known as Caleacte - on the instructions of an oracle. It took its name from the Greek characterization of its land as a “Fair Shore,” and was a beautiful country to traverse on foot or by horse or carriage. Many Greek colonists were driven here initially for such beauty and fertility of the land before settling in other towns along the coastline. Many living here found luxury and profit in fishing on the marvelous beaches and just off the calm coast."
 ###Tyndaria
 tyndaria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Tyndaridae"
 tyndaria_heritage_desc:0 "Set on a prominent hill overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, Tyndaris it was one of the last new Greek sites on the isle of Sicily, despite its promising and defensible location. Messenian exiles from the Peloponnese built this place, driven across the sea by the relentless pursuit of the Spartans after the Peloponnesian War. The exiles, happy in refuge, named the city for their native gods, the “Tyndaridae,” a form of the famous Dioscuri. With a policy of free acceptance, their numbers rose quickly to that of a comemborable city in the region. From its high vantage point, the Tyndarians could look out over the Lipari islands and the Knidian colonists there who had a history of fending off Etruscan raids and invasions."

## Magna Graecia Heritages
 ###Rhegium
 rhegium_heritage:0 "Heritage of Bronze Bergamot Mirages"
 rhegium_heritage_desc:0 "Originally named Erythra, or “Red,” which may have been the meaning of the local name for the place, Rhegium and then Phoibeia were the names this city was known by - the latter for a short while and on account of a strong veneration of Apollo. The term ‘Italia’ once referred to the region around Rhegium itself, taken from the local king named Italus. This city was one of the first colonies to be settled by the Greeks after Cumae, with the Chalkians arriving in the 8th century BCE. The Greeks there once claimed that it was in fact King Locastus, son of the wind-god Aeolus, who founded this place, and so they honored him on their coins. In part due to their control over the strait of Scylla, the people of Rhegion became, alongside their city, some of the wealthiest Greeks in Magna Graecia, reaching a golden period under the tyrant Anaxilas in the 5th century BCE. Even assailed by many Greek competitors and the Etruscan pirate fleets, Rhegion rebuffed all opponents and continued to be a place of heavy trade and cultural boon, hosting academies dedicated to the arts and sciences, including the Pythagorean School."
 ###Locri
 locri_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Western Locrians"
 locri_heritage_desc:0 "Known as Epizephyrian Locris, taken from Zephyros, or the West Wind, Locris of Calabria was a settlement brought about in 680 BCE by colonists from Opus, among the Opuntian Locrians. Their colonizing party also contained Ozolian Locrians, known as West Locrians, as well as Lacedaemonians. The location of the city was actually not the first site of settlement, but fierce winds and weather forced the first colonists to relocate to a better, more-protected location for their city. Called the “Flower of Italy” by Plato, it had a difficult time passing laws in its early years due to the policies proposed by such powerful figures as the philosopher Zaleucus, who proclaimed that, should a law proposed not pass, the proposer be hanged - this man had supposedly begun as a slave or shepherd before taking education. Here, Persephone was worshiped as a protector of marriage and childbirth, which is in most places the function of Hera. The town grew into a prosperous enough place to send out its own colonists and found the neighboring cities of Hipponion and Medma."
 ###Hipponion
 hipponion_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Displaced"
 hipponion_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Lokroi Epizephyrion in the late 7th century BCE, Hipponion lived a life under the thumb of other Greek city-states. In 388 BCE, Dionysius the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse, came into control over this city and removed the population, either to a different city under Syracusan control or to Syracusan territory itself. Yet, it is said that ten years later the people returned to Hipponion with the aid of Carthaginian influence in the region. Yet, while their fears across the strait of Scylla may have abated, the tribes of the Brutti came to own dominion over them instead, demanding such honors as tribute."
 ###Bruttia
 bruttia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Rebellious Deer"
 bruttia_heritage_desc:0 "The Bruttians, otherwise known as Brettioi, meaning “deer,” once inhabited all of the Calabria region before the arrival of the Greeks. Yet, even with the Greeks shoving them into the hinterland of their own homelands, these people held quickly onto the high hills and mountains in the region, where they were strongest. They were themselves once subject to the Lucanians and held a lower social level among the tribes of southern Italy, but they gained their independence in 356 BCE and their name came to be associated with rebels and fugitives."
 ###Thuria
 thuria_heritage:0 "Heritage of Refounding"
 thuria_heritage_desc:0 "The colony of Thurii was settled by Athenians and nearby people from the city of Sybaris in 443 BCE. A monument to Magnesian Philoctetes rests there, along with his arrows, and so the people believed that he had some part in deciding the location of their city. For 58 years, the destruction of this place by neighboring Croton left the town barren, and it remained so until 452 BCE, when exiles from the same Sybaris came to re-found this city under the leadership of some unknown Thessalian. Such was the quick growth and prosperity of the city that it became the jealousy of all of Croton and its other neighbors, be they Greeks or barbarians. So, there went on a pattern of expulsion and refounding at the hands of different foreign supporters. Herodotus himself took part in one colonization of this place, another the orator Lysias, and the sophist Protagoras - whom Pericles requested go and establish new laws in this place, the like of which were similar to those of Zaleucus of Lokroi Epizephyrion. The first founding of this place had been at a fountain called “Thuria,” and so the place took its name from this fountain. Thereafter, it was a prosperous place which also found itself constantly embroiled in wars with other Greeks in Italy."
 ###Lucania
 lucania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Displacers"
 lucania_heritage_desc:0 "An Italic tribe living in the region of the same name, the Lucani tribes-people spoke an Oscan language in the south of Italy. They used the Greek alphabet to write out their Oscan-Umbrian variant in inscriptions, similar to the neighboring Samnites who had assimilated the Oscans themselves. Yet, this place was not the original home of the Lucani tribe, and it is said that they instead migrated into the area in the 5th century BCE, displacing the local tribes the Greeks knew as the Oenotrians, Chones, and Lauternoi. Soon after, this newly settled tribe waged war against the Greek city of Tarentum and later against Alexander of Epirus, which pulled Epirus into the sphere of Magna Graecia much greater than it had originally intended. Yet, unlike their uncivilized neighbors, the elites of these tribes relished in both warring with the Greeks while also commissioning great pieces of art from Greek masters in the fashion of the Etruscans in the north."
 ###Herakleia
 herakleia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Herakleia Lucania"
 herakleia_heritage_desc:0 "Found nestled between the rivers Aciris and Siris, Herakleia in Lucania was one of the later Greek colonies built in Magna Graecia. It seems to have been built atop the old foundations of the Ionic colony of Siris, and because of the contentious grounds it was settled upon, the city was often caught in the middle of disputes brought about by its neighbors and cities back in Greece which laid claim over ancient Siris. It was founded by the Thurians from Thurii, in the area of ancient Sybaris, and its creation was the result of a compromise between states, at least for a time. When this town was then moved 24 stadia away to a more agreeable location, the old Siris did not simply die, but became the subordinate port and emporion of this new Herakleia. Aided by the prosperity of their founding Thurians and the support of nearby Tarentum, Herakleia quickly prospered and became a wealthy city among wealthy Greek cities in southern Italy. It fostered famous painters, such as Zeuxis, and became a fount of culture."
 ###Messapia
 messapia_heritage:0 "A Heritage Amid Water"
 messapia_heritage_desc:0 "The Messapii, who spoke their own Messapic language, were one of the Iapygian tribes local to south-eastern Italy. Living on the limestone-filled Salento peninsula, they, like their relatives to the north, supposedly crossed the Adriatic Sea from Illyria, emerging as sub-tribes with close ties to their original homeland. Their name may have been related to their peninsular home, meaning “Amid Water.” This may have happened as early as the Bronze Age, such as at the pre-italic site of Gnatia which was created in the 15th century BCE. Over the time, the Messapii grew a distinct identity which differentiated them from the other Iapyges tribes in Italy, especially with their language, and they were more prone to urbanize and densely populate their settlements than their kin. Each of these settlements acted in the fashion of city-states, as there was no great central pan-Messapic government which controlled them all. Their growing power led to their involvement in several wars involving both neighboring tribes and the Greek cities of Magna Graecia which equally saw them as civilized allies and powerful threats."
 ###Apulia
 apulia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Iapygians"
 apulia_heritage_desc:0 "The region of Apulia saw foregin colonization long before the Iapygian tribal migrations from Illyria. The Bronze Age Mycenaean Greeks had come to visit, trade with, and colonize this place during the times before the supposed Trojan War and long before the Bronze Age Collapse in the eastern Mediterranean. While the Messapii largely settled in the southeasternmost point in Italy, the tribes settling the region of Apulia were the Daunians and the Peucetians. These were respectively the ‘wolf’ tribe, bringing the Balkan wolf-cult to Italy, and the Peucetians, who the Greeks claim have an Arcadian origin. Both these tribes, fortified in their separate towns, began to hellenize as they traded heavily with the Greek city-states on the Italian coast in the region. Thus, they mixed Greek elements into their native religion. They favored wearing ornamental dress in daily life, and were extravagant in look."
 ###Samnium
 samnium_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Samnites"
 samnium_heritage_desc:0 "The Samnites, who may have once been a tribe of the Sabines, were an Oscan-speaking people who formed a confederation of four main tribes in the territory of Samnium. The Samnites became staunch adversaries of the Romans after a period of working with them against the threat of the Gauls in 354 BCE. Samnium favored an agricultural and livestock economy which the Samnite tribes took advantage of - lacking a great amount of rich resources in the mountainous and hilly territory, they practiced a mixture of pastoralism and mixed farming in order to both feed themselves and sell crops to their neighbors. By the Hellenistic Period they had grown beyond the simple warlord-chieftain model of rulership, and had established a political system focused around rural settlements led by magistrates, called “Pagi.” They were able to support this government with a rigorous military regiment. The combination of cavalry and infantry, the “Belliger Samnis,” proved to instill fear in their enemies. Fighting against the Greek city-states and especially against Rome taught the Samnites to form their bands of warriors into armies resembling the Hellenic blocks of spears, swords, shields, and the whining of horses."
 ###Nuceria
 nuceria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Walnut League"
 nuceria_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that an Etruscan princess fled her home town in the pursuit of love yet died in these areas unsatisfied. In the memory of his dear daughter, her father built a town and named it after her. Others have said that the name instead came from a time when a great flood came through this area and took away all the great woods but a single walnut tree - the walnut being “nux/nucis.” The original Oscan-speaking people of Italy settled this area first, along with other such sites as Pompeii, setting up a large group of fortified towns to guard the fertile valley in the region. At some point, the Etruscans themselves came to control Nuceria when they created Etruria Campana, or the Etruscan dodecapolis league in the Campania region. It then changed hands when the Etruscans departed the region following their defeat at Cumae, and instead the powerful Samnites confederation took control of the entire region, giving the settlement its name of Nuceria Alfterna, with the added word taken from the Alfaterni tribe among the Samnites. In the end, the city would go its own way, creating its own league to count on for economic and military support - the Nucerian League - including neighboring settlements such as Cumae, Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Sorrento. To run this league and its own administrative functions, the local Nucerian language was used, which combined elements of the Greek and Etruscan languages."
 ###Sipontum
 sipontum_heritage:0 "Heritage of Diomedes, Son of Diomedes"
 sipontum_heritage_desc:0 "Diomedes was famed for building this port - no, not the Diomedes who fought at Troy, but his son named Diomedes whom he had with the daughter of the Daunian king. The city itself, while a Greek settlement, was surrounded by Iapygian Illyrians and even fell into the hands of the Samnites for a time being Alexander of Epirus, uncle of Alexander the great, retook it in 355 BCE. The city, surrounded by tribes, thus relied heavily on trading Greek-made and imported goods with the many Illyrian peoples littered all around them, both in Italy and across the Adriatic in Illyria. They had kin in the other Greek colonies on the opposite coast, but would have to contend with the rapidly-changing landscape of Italy during the rise of Rome."

 ##loulan_heritage:0 "Loulan Heritage"
 ##loulan_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the edge of the Lop Desert, which joins the Tarim Basin, it sat at the beginning of the Northern Route which would become one of the main threads of the Silk Road. The quick-growing and cosmopolitan cities of the Loulan Kingdom allowed for it to control much of the trade in the area and to expand, encompassing rival cities in order to negate neighborly competition. It sits poised to control much of the Tarim Basin with its growing power."

 frentania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Frentani"
 frentania_heritage_desc:0 "The Frentani were an Italic tribe ranging from the Apennines to the Adriatic and shared a large border with the belligerent tribes of the Samnites. Yet, some of the ancients called these people a tribe of the Samnites themselves - the distinction between the two was assured when they took different sides on the issue of Rome. They were quickly subjugated by the Romans, separately from the Samnites, around the year 319 BCE. Relegated to a great series of hills, the Frentani were rather well-endowed with fertile lands, having many rivers running through it which originate in the Samnite mountains. Some of the coins minted there contained the Oscan term “Frentrei,” which may have referred either to the people themselves, or the supposed capital of Frentrum, from which the loose central government ruled."
 ###Pelignia
 pelignia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Half-Breeds"
 pelignia_heritage_desc:0 "The Pelgini tribe was an Oscan-Umbrian group in eastern Italy which practiced a limited central government in the form of rural-based magistrates called “meddixes.” In this and other parts of their culture, they were influenced by the Greeks who had colonized the region of Magna Graecia, and added some of the Hellenic gods to their own pantheon, such as the Dioscuri. Like many other smaller tribes in the region, they submitted to Roman subjugation after the great Samnite confederation had been beaten back multiple times by the Latins. Their unusual name may have taken inspiration from the meaning of the term “Half-breeds,” perhaps alluding to their cultural mixture with other Oscan-speaking tribes."
 ###Marsia
 marsia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Marsi"
 marsia_heritage_desc:0 "Centered around their chief town of Marruvium on the eastern shore of lake Fucinus, the Marsi tribe were an Umbrian-speaking people, with either a dialect or their own group-language termed ‘Marsian.’ Comprising only a small piece of territory, to survive, the Marsi tribe joined their neighbors in a confederation - the Vestini, Peligni, and Marrucini. But when tribal confederations such as the powerful Samnites failed to challenge Rome, the Marsi submitted to the Latins - luckily, the two shared an incredibly similar language and would therefore have found many bonds between themselves with which to maintain good relations. At their central lake of Fucinus, the Marsi venerated the Italic goddess Angitia in her grove-temple."
 ###Sabinia
 sabinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sabines"
 sabinia_heritage_desc:0 "The Sabines have always maintained an intricate and deep connection to Rome. Roman legend tells the story of how the Sabine population divided, recalling how the Romans abducted Sabine women to populate their new city and these women ended the ensuing war between the Sabine men and the Romans by throwing themselves amidst the battle-lines. Thereafter, the Sabine king Titus Tatius jointly ruled over Rome with Romulus, and his kingdom and people became Rome and Roman following his death and the assimilation into a new equites class. The Claudi gens of Rome boast of their Sabine lineage in this way, giving themselves a cognomen of Sabinus, relishing in the story. While this combination of Sabine, Roman, and likely other similarly-spoken Italic groups must have come together to form the Roman population and identity, the truth was that not all Sabines joined in the Roman project, and the half of the population that remained a hill and mountain-living tribe continued to wage costly wars against Rome no matter the cost - perhaps this was to avenge the lost pride in the rape of their women so long ago…"
 ###Picentia
 picentia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Woodpeckers"
 picentia_heritage_desc:0 "Populating the region of Picenum, the Picentes could be separately identified in two groups, the “North Picenes” and “South Picenes.” While each group shared similarities with its counterpart, the southern members held a more Italic culture while the northern tribes expressed several non-Italic elements, possibly taking from the Celtic groups which had moved into Cisalpine Gaul and northern Italy over the last two centuries. The Italic language the southerners spoke south of Ancona was of the Umbrian group. The Romans claimed that the Picentes, or at least some of their southern settlements, were the product of Sabine colonists, which would explain their kin nature to the pan-sabellian cultural continuum. However, the story also goes that a woodpecker led these people to their final residence in Picenum - this reliance on the guidance of a patron-animal is common in Italic mythological tradition."
 ###Umbria
 umbria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Great Thunderstorm"
 umbria_heritage_desc:0 "Coming to being as a settled and identifiable people from the 9th-4th centuries BCE, the Umbri spoke the regional language of Umbrian, for which the linguistic group and region are named after. While some ancient authors have considered them to have been of Gallic origin, there was also an understanding that the Umbri may have been the oldest of all Italic peoples, called Ombrii, or “the people of the thunderstorm,” on account of surviving the great deluge which flooded the world - if this should be true, then the Umbri survived solely alongside Greek Deucalion, and are as old as the Greeks themselves. In their political structure, there were two great men who supervised rituals and official affairs, members of the magistry of “Uhtur.” Like other Italic peoples, the Umbri borrowed components of Greek culture through trade and migrants from the Greek colonies in Italy. While they waged war with the neighboring Etruscans on many occasions, they were also very open to Etruscan exports and the culture of the symposium, accompanied by much wine."
 ###Ancona
 ancona_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Tyrian Elbow"
 ancona_heritage_desc:0 "The region around Ancona had been dominated by Picentes as early as the 6th century BCE when Syracusan settlers arrived to establish a greater city overtop a Picentian settlement in 387 BCE. Its name is taken from the Greek for ‘elbow,’ since the port was protected by a promontory shaped like an elbow. This city was thus valuable to the Greeks because they managed to set up a dye factory here which produced the expensive Tyrian Purple which sold like gold on the markets. The wealth from this dye trade and that of other goods which were sold both back to Greek cities as well as the natural-resource-endowed Illyrian and Italic tribes brought Ancona to prominence and enough of an independent economic system that it began minting its own coins - these depicted a bent arm holding a palm branch on the obverse and the head of Aphrodite on the reverse."
 ###Senones
 senones_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sacking Rome"
 senones_heritage_desc:0 "While the Senones have a home in greater Gaul, called the “Ancient Ones,” some part of them had passed from the Seine basin all the way past the Alps to the lands of northern Italy. They moved into the upper region of the Umbri and Picentes peoples, bordering the city of Ancona on the coast around the same period as the other Celtic tribes moved into the Cisalpine region, joining the migrations of Bellovesus, crossing the great mountains around 400 BCE - their territory was called the ‘Ager Gallicus.’ The town of Sena Gallica was built as their capital, and in 391 BCE they continued their grand movement, invading the eastern territories of Etruria around Clusium under the leadership of the famous Brennus of the Senones. In defense of the Etruscans, the Romans joined the war, violating the laws regulating war between two peoples, and so the Senones turned on them as well. The Romans were destroyed in the 390 BCE Battle of Allia, and the barbarians soon after marched on Rome itself, sacking it. This tribe of the Senones accomplished two things - assuring the Roman fear and anger towards the Gauls, and trapping them into more than 100 years of war with the Senones in Italy."
 ###Boi
 boi_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Warrior Shepherds"
 boi_heritage_desc:0 "Similar to the Senones which sacked Rome, the clans of the Boii which migrated over the Alps and into Cisalpine Gaul where one sect of their tribal group - the other remained in Central Europe in the area of modern-day Bohemia. Like the other Celts coming in, they did not expel but joined a great quantity of the northern Etruscans in their Po-valley settlements, turning the city of Felsina into their own capital of Bononia - a city which traced its first inhabitation back to the 3rd millennium BCE. From the etymology of their name, they either referred to themselves as the “herding people” or the “warrior people” - their contemporaries claimed their wealth rested with their great herds of cattle as much as it did with their golden coffers. Perhaps, then both of these meanings were used, as they gained through warfare and pastoralism. Instead of brute strength or pure wealth, the elites of the Boii treated comradeship as the most important quality, measuring their social power by the number of attendants and associates they possessed."
 ###Lingonia
 lingonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Jumpers"
 lingonia_heritage_desc:0 "Literally “The Jumpers,” the Lingones were yet another tribe to split into groups, with one crossing the Alps to settle in Cisalpine Gaul during the 5th and 4th century BCE migrations, arriving slightly earlier than some of the other tribes at around 400 BCE itself. Some claim that, due to their proximity and mutual aims with the Senones, they also aided in the famed conquest and sacking of Rome in 390 BCE alongside the army of Brennus. Their name may have had to do with a specific technique while riding horses, or may have instead referred to a unique dancing practice."
 ###Veneto
 veneto_heritage:0 "Heritage of the People of Passion"
 veneto_heritage_desc:0 "It cannot be confirmed, but many scholars, both ancient and modern, have come to a general conclusion that the name ‘Veneti’ may have come from the idea of ‘passion’ or ‘grace.’ These passionate people spoke a language called Venetic that, while containing large similarities to Latin and other Italic languages, maintained elements of Germanic and Celtic speech. Herodotus, confused as he may have been, claimed that the marriage customs of these people, whom he both claimed to have been of Veneto and in other cases of Illyria, mirrored that of the Babylonians. Others have come to the legendary conclusion that the Veneti were in fact Anatolian in origin, being from Paphlagonia, and were simply led west to the coast of the Adriatic Sea by the Trojan prince Antenor following the end of the great 10-year war in the kingdom of Prium. The Veneti are then, supposedly, Paphlagonians and Trojans who merged with the native Euganei tribe of the region. However famous this supposed exodus was, the Greeks seemed to have viewed the Veneti as being most famous for their horses, for which the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse founded trading colonies along the Venetian coast in order to acquire - he specifically adored the town of Adria for trade, aiding in its construction of canals so as to break the monopoly the city of Spina held over the sea. For their own part, the Veneti maintained peace along their borders with friendly relationships among the other Celts."
 ###Cenomannia
 cenomannia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Friendly Tribe"
 cenomannia_heritage_desc:0 "Living along the northern stretch of the Padus river, the Cenomanni of Cisalpine Gaul migrated to this area, coming over the Alps around 400 BCE under the leadership of Elitovius. It is said that some of them also settled west around the area of Massalia and the territory of the Volcae. Unlike their neighbors, they were less bellicose to the Hellenic groups to the south, and were more cautious in crossing the Padus to commit themselves to war."
 ###Insubria
 insubria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sophisticated Migrants"
 insubria_heritage_desc:0 "At one point called the most important Celtic tribe in all of Italy, the Insubres were one of the first to enter Cisalpine Gaul and establish themselves in the Po Valley. They were the ones to settle the town of Mediolanum at least after 600 BCE, which sat upon a good trading position and became a quite prosperous town. It is said in legend that the Gaulish king Ambicatus sent his nephew, Bellovesus, into Cisalpine Gaul in charge of a great Gallic party of tribes - he is then supposed to have founded Mediolanum in the time of Tarquinius Priscus. The insubres themselves were a mixed culture of Celtic-migrated elements as well as influences from the past Golasecca culture. Their oligarchic society relied on their relationships with established peoples such as the Etruscans and Veneti to create a more advanced and sophisticated society."
 ###Taurinia
 taurinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Bull Tribe"
 taurinia_heritage_desc:0 "Coming from the Celtic ‘tauros’ for ‘bull,’ the Taurini were a Celtic-Ligurian tribe residing asound the Padus river. It is difficult to tell whether they were a Celtic tribe which simply inhabited ancient Ligurian lands, a Celtic tribe which had been influenced by the Ligurian people they encountered, or were a Ligurian tribe which had been Celticized during the great migrations over the Alps."
 ###Ilvatia
 ilvatia_heritage:0 "Ilvatan Heritage"
 ilvatia_heritage_desc:0 "A ligurian tribe on the border with the newer, recently migrated, Celtic tribes, the Ilvates lived on the northern side of the Ligurian Apennines which faced the inner Padus valley. Unlike the wishy-washy natures of their Celtic neighbors in war, these Ligurians understood the value of protecting their own homeland of many generations, and so they fought fiercely and continuously to maintain the safety of their borders."
 ###Genuatia
 genuatia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Emporion of the Ligurians"
 genuatia_heritage_desc:0 "Unlike many of the other Ligurian tribes, the Genuati made a great habit of trading with the Etruscans, Italians, and Greek merchants - be they from the Italian coast or from Gallic Massalia. While the site of Genua had been inhabited as early as the fifth or fourth millennium BCE, the famous “Emporion of the Ligurians” at Genua began to be recognized as a great trading center some time in the 5th century BCE. Skins, timber, and honey left the port for foreign markets while wine, pottery, and luxury items entered alongside exotic merchants. As the power of Genua, which the Etruscans called “Kainua” or ‘new city’ rose, it competed with the current Genuati port market of Portus Veneris, which already maintained good relations with the Hellenic peoples to the south and west."
 ###Ingaunia
 ingaunia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Painted Ligurians"
 ingaunia_heritage_desc:0 "A Ligurian tribe influenced by the recently migrated Celts, the Ingauni may have, in name, been thought of as the ‘painted ones’ among the Ligurians. The loss of the ‘p’ which would refer to the picti, or the painted ones of Caledonia, may have to do with a mixture of the Ligurian and Celtic languages. They established their capital at Album Ingaunum  - “the white hill” - on the coast, which was built in the 4th century BCE on a hillside. These people often waged war with their northern neighbors higher up in the mountains, the Epanterii, who raided the richer lands of the Ingauni on occasion when life became harsh and riches became scarce. The Ingauni were thus often to employ the services of other peoples and mercenaries to help defend their white hill."
 ###Intimilia
 intimilia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Intimilii"
 intimilia_heritage_desc:0 "Situated on the Ligurian coast among the other Ligurian tribes south of the westernmost Apennines, the Intimilii could be found housed in the oppidum of Album Initmilium - like their neighbors, the Ingauni, their fort was called the “white hill” fort. However, while they did skirmish with the mountain-dwelling Epanterii tribe which plagued their Ingauni neighbors, the Intimilii also made an extra effort to control their coastal waters with a mix or piratry and a fearsome fleet of harassment-based ships.  It is said that these tribesmen came into arms for no reason and were always prepared for a war."

## Sardinian Heritages
 ###Longonensia
 tibulatia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Corsians"
 tibulatia_heritage_desc:0 "The Longonenses, who live at the northernmost edge of Sardinia, were said to have been closest to the Corsi, for whom Corsica was named. They had settled around the town of Longones, a strategic location which could be found near the northernmost tip of the island, from which they could control the traffics in the Taphros Strait and see the shores of southern Corsica with the naked eye. For this reason, the Longonenses were a well-endowed trading people, genial and hospitable yet always ready to draw out their swords in case of necessity. Their land stretches further in the south, incorporating the valleys and the harsh mountains of the north-east - terrain that provides enough defense against any foe that hopes to catch them unawares."
 ###Coracensia
 coracensia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Dry Port"
 coracensia_heritage_desc:0 "Out of the Balarians, the Coracensians, and the nearby tribes related to them, may be considered as truly blessed with an unmatched seafiring skill that could rival any of their peers - even the Iliensians of Tyrsenia. It is said that in the times of old, when the Phoenicians did not yet depart from their land in the east, these Balarians would have occupied the islands in the west of Sardinia, to which it is said they gave their own name - the Balearic islands. Moreover, there they erected hundreds of Nuraghes to appease the Father, and the island named as 'Mago' by Carthaginians, was instead known as 'Nura', akin to our 'Nure' and the tribe of the Nurrenses who inhabit it."
 ###Luguidonensia
 luguidonensia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Balaria"
 luguidonensia_heritage_desc:0 "Among the Balarians, the Luguidonenses are one of the most prominent tribes of northern Sardinia. Builders of Nuraghes like their neighbors, the people of Luguido, during the centuries of warfare that has plagued their nation, managed to expand into a sizeable amount of land which streches from the mountains to the sea, enclosed by the ancient and bellicose Iliensian tribes in the south and the warmongering Corsi tribes in the northern mountains. Yet honorable like any proud Sardana, the Balarians of these lands would side apart any everlasting divergence when it comes the time to fight a foreign foe."
 ###Kelsitania
 celesitania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ilienses"
 celesitania_heritage_desc:0 "Out of those peoples who erected the Nuraghes a long time ago, the Sardana of Kelsitania and the numerous tribes among them are the descendants of those who once occupied the fertile Iolean Plain. After decades of wars against Carthaginians and the ill-fated arrival of poisonous mists that choked the Plain, they were forced to flee to the mountains, a place from which no foreign army has ever managed to dislodge them. By foreign sources, they were known by many names - some refer to them as Ioleans, descendants of Iolaos, nephew of Herakles, whereas others used to call them Iliensians, from Ilio, the old name of Troy. Even the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, who had spoke about the fate of the Ioleans, had said that they would have maintained their freedom in eternity - a promise which endures till this day."
 ###Rubrensia
 rubrinsia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sardo"
 rubrinsia_heritage_desc:0 "Settled on a stretch of land that lies between the highest mountain peaks of Sardinia and the Mare Tyrrhenum in the east, the Rubrensians, together with a number of tribes akin to them, occupy the most enclosed and isolated corner of the island. It is said that among all of the Sardana people, those who dwell in these valleys and mountains are truly acquainted with the ancient rites and the knowledge trasferred by Sardò, our Father, to the very first men. Since childhood, the youth of these lands are sent into the wild where they hone the ancient skills of their ancestors; alone in a hostile environment that is rich in foes and scarce in water and food, trained to never surrender, to never submit and to only obey to the truth of the forefathers - these are the principles that guide their people. Those who survive are taught the art of the spear and archery before being introduced to the art of the sword and the pleasures of life at sea. Those distinguished by merit, both in battle and life, are rewarded with the horned helmets and destined to a seat of honour at the Norgoddoe, the Sardinian heaven, for all eternity."

## Brittonic Heritages
 ###Cantiacia
 cantiacia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Alder Grove"
 cantiacia_heritage_desc:0 "Situated on the southern Britanic coast, close to the many Gallic tribes to the south, the Cantii tribe was a beneficiary of heavy trade, population migration, and the transfer of ideas. For this reason, they could be seen as similar to the continental Gauls in many customs and wares, and were sometimes considered the most advanced and sophisticated tribe among all the tribes in Britannia. Their capital of Durovernum Cantiacorum, possibly taken from the meaning of “Stronghold of the Cantiaci by the Alder Grove,” was well-fortified with three sets of deep ditches and assault-prevention measures."
 ###Durotrigia
 durotrigia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fort-Dwellers"
 durotrigia_heritage_desc:0 "Meaning “Fort-Dwellers,” the Durotriges lived on the southern coast of Britannia in a land filled with hillforts. One of the few tribes to issue their own coins before Mediterranean interference, they seemed to have had policies of perfection with their coin minting - many of their coins have been found in exterior territories and re-minted - the confederation which made up the Durotriges had unique policies. They buried their dead in trenches with some form of last ritual meal no matter how they had to manage it, no matter how difficult the circumstances. Their fortified capital in the Durnovaria, specifically the Maiden Castle hillfort, had been inhabited since at least 4000 BCE but had been built up into a strong citadel for the tribal rulers. Its significant fortifications were erected around 600 BCE, but was upgraded again around 450 BCE to enclose a size three times the previous site. This fort not only provided the greatest protection for the nobility and tribal members, but also functioned as a central hub of commerce and communication."
 ###Dobunnia
 dobunnia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Victorious Submitters"
 dobunnia_heritage_desc:0 "Their name may have also once been spelled Bodunni, meaning “The Victorious Ones,” owing to some sense of prowess in battle or achievement in civilization. Like their immediate southern neighbors, the Dobunni were one of the tribes to mint their own coins before coming into close contact with any Mediterranean power - these coins often depicted a branched emblem, possibly a crop of importance. Unlike their war-happy neighbors, however, the Dobunni seem to have been more eager to socialize, submit to visibly greater powers, and embrace foreign cultures which they felt added sophistication to their society. While their political power may have had its seat at the hillfort which would come to be known as Corinium Dobunnorum, the people flourished in nearby oppida, or towns, through which trade and migrants flowed."
 ###Trinovantia
 trinovantia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Vigorous New Troy"
 trinovantia_heritage_desc:0 "Situated along the Tamesas, or ‘dark,’ river, the Trinovanti may have taken their name from the meaning of “the very vigorous people.” For their control of both a fertile and river-access prone area, as well as their close location to the more sophisticated tribes in the south which dealt in great trade, the Trinovanti were considered by some to have at one point been the most powerful of all the Brythonic tribes. Likewise, their culture maintained similar elements with the continental Belgae tribes, who were some of the fiercest peoples among all the Celts. They despised the concept of being subjugated and being dishonored, and were therefore easy to anger within these social and political means. Some even believed that their tribe had a Mediterranean origin in ancient Ilion - Brutus came to Britannia and settled the site of Trinovantum as a “New Troy.” Should this be true, then their ability to hold their own against great odds and to fight hardened armies held an old tradition."
 ###Siluria
 siluria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kindred Tribes"
 siluria_heritage_desc:0 "A loose confederation or perhaps simply a very large tribe, the Silures were a modern Wales-dwelling group in Britannia best described as fierce, powerful, or warlike. They knew well the tactics of guerilla warfare, and asymmetrical combat which differed from the great formations of Mediterranean powers. These people could be compared in physical description to the Celts in Gaul or Hispania, bearing dark, curly hair and a darker complexion which set them apart from the far northern red-haired tribes of Britannia. Some in fact believed these people, and perhaps their neighbors, had originally come from the coast of Hispania. Their name, taken from the Celtic meaning of ‘seed’ or ‘stock’ may have provided a unifying element to hold their tribal structure together, pulling on familial and physical ties. The site of the Llanvair Discoed hillfort was a place of power for them, if not an acting political capital and unification center. This place had old traditions tracing back to the Neolithic period with a collection of standing stones, but the hillfort of the Celts was built during the 4th century BCE. Among many other places, some have said that this fort was the very same ‘Celliwig’ (Camelot) where the legendary King Arthur held his court."
 ###Demetia
 demetia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Golden Dyfed"
 demetia_heritage_desc:0 "West of the Silures lie the Demetae, who may have been the ancient people of the land and petty kingdom of Dyfed in modern Wales which is the setting of several tales in the four branches of the Mabinogi - Brythonic Welsh myths. This area saw both trade and social connections between the area of Wales and that of the Dumnnonians in the south around modern Cornwall, as well as that of the peoples of Hibernia, who would migrate and mix with the Brythonic Welsh population. The land itself is some of the least mountainous in the area and was good for pasturing and the grazing of herds of sheep and other docile animals. Not only did they benefit from this rich grazing land, but the nearby mountains provided a rich deposit of gold, especially around the valley of the river Corfi, where the mines Ogofau Gold Mines would be built."
 ###Ordovicia
 ordovicia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ordovices"
 ordovicia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the proudest peoples, the Ordovici were less than willing to take on the customs and habits of foreigners, preferring to rely on local traditions. Though it is not certain, their name may have derived from the same meaning as ‘hammer,’ perhaps indicating their proficiency in smithing and mining the rough materials their mountain-home held. This tribe may have predominantly lived in the central and northern areas of modern Wales, but it may have also controlled the isle of Mona, which had on it a group of many important druids and worshippers. These men may have used the separation of the adjacent strait as a way of finding seclusion and a greater connection with nature."
 ###Deceanglia
 deceanglia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Deceangli"
 deceanglia_heritage_desc:0 "Based around the site of Canovium at the lowest fordable point on the river once known as Cynwy, the Deceangli tribe held only a small territory in the northeast of modern Wales, but were richly-endowed in the Clwydian hills. Many mines bore large slabs of lead and silver ore, which were used for their own tribes-people or sold abroad to those who would build or make jewelry."
 ###Cornivia
 cornivia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the People of the Horn"
 cornivia_heritage_desc:0 "Builders of many hill forts like their Brittonic neighbors, the Cornovii are notable for having made in a great many ceramic containers for the purpose of storing salt - necessary for food preservation. While they were an aggressive and fierce group, the Cornovii were not particularly wealthy in trade or in ownership, bearing few luxuries and riches their neighbors came to possess in the same period. What wealth they did possess was in the quantity of building materials and stone they could take out of the ground in localized quarries. Great amounts of limestone could be found in the area, including underneath one of their main settlements at the later Roman fort of Deva Victrix. Their stronghold of Uiroconion, later Roman Viroconium, meant “city of the man-wolf” or ‘werewolf,’ perhaps stemming from a local legend or rather their likeness to wolves hunting in a pack amidst battle."
 ###Coritania
 coritania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Coritani"
 coritania_heritage_desc:0 "A largely peaceful and agricultural people in the east of Britannia, the Coritani lived largely confined lives, being ruled by multiple petty kings under a loose federation with perhaps one overarching king with little jurisdiction beyond his own personal domain. Their capital at Ratae Coritanorum was built around two streams with a marshy island in the middle, providing minor defense and possibly acting more as a crossing point and a place of trade for agricultural and a few luxury goods which passed through."
 ###Parisia
 parisia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Brittonic Parisi"
 parisia_heritage_desc:0 "These folk may be related to the Parisii tribe of Gaul, but the connection is not certain. What is certain is that their position in Britannia was precarious, being surrounded on all slides by the Brigantes and then the river Humber. Some say that they possessed an Opportunum Sinus, or “Good Harbor,” while others claim that this was instead simply a natural promontory which protected the coast where they had settled - perhaps this is the same Portus Felix or “Lucky Port,” which the Romans later settle in this area. If this tribe did have some connection to their continental kin of the same name, passage by ship would have been their means at arriving in this new coastal land in Britannia. This port, which may have been the same Eboracum which the Romans came to favor, meaning “the place of the yew tree,” was a great stronghold for the Parisi, and proved if not to be the lucky port to at least be a defensible place for their tribe."
 ###Brigantia
 brigantia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Powerful Highlanders"
 brigantia_heritage_desc:0 "The largest of the tribes in Britannia, the Brigantes, may have taken their name from the meaning of ‘high’ or ‘powerful.’ These people also shared a similarity in name with the Celtic goddess Brigantia, who could be compared to Tyche, Minerva, or Victoria, meaning the “The High One.” She may have represented an understanding of power and success through victory in battle against all opponents. This pursuance of domination may have led to their great size, as a confederation, grown over generations of war and consolidation by many successful kings - the sub-tribes of the Brigantes fought as an auxiliary army for their rulers in the confederation. Their political center of Isurium Brigantum held both great access to the nearby river Iseur as well as a great many fields which fed the population. The river also brought trade and a place of natural defense. This tribe may have also once been under the control of a powerful queen, as the Caledoni to the north would claim the Romans were almost beaten by a woman ruling this tribe."
 ###Carvetia
 carvetia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Deer People"
 carvetia_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly meaning, the people of the deer, the Carvetii lived north of the numerous Brigantes. Perhaps as a visual symbol of their animalistic and horned nature, the Carvetii worshiped the god Belatucadros, who others identified as Mars Belatucadros for the warlike nature of the horned god. Being the “fair-slayer” this deity may have represented the aggressive and disciplined nature of the tribe, for how else could they have remained independent in the face of the vast Brigantian confederation. The site of Clifton Dikes was their central place of power, which would also come to be known as Luguvalium, meaning “the strength of Lugus,” one of the main Celtic deities who radiates power and control."
 ###Votadinia
 votadinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Otadini"
 votadinia_heritage_desc:0 "The Votadini lived in the place which comprised the southern portion of the region that would come to be known as the “Old North,” after contact between the isle of Britannia and the continent of Europa ceased. The Votadini, or Otadini, therefore lived at the very edge of Mediterranean influence, the ancestors of the legendary Gododdin people of later modern Wales. The Celtic cultural continuum and the formation of petty hill-fort kingdoms began in this place around the 8th century BCE with a major fort being built at the site of Traprain Law, where successive burial had already formed a strong ritual connection between the land and the tribes-people. Yet, while they were an old and rooted people, when it came through their lands, they welcomed the riches of other places and lands which they could never visit themselves - luxury items, wines, and fashioned silvers were their pleasure."
 ###Damnonia
 damnonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Deep Ones"
 damnonia_heritage_desc:0 "Living in the far northwest of Britannia, at the edge of the midland Brythonic people and what became the feared Picti, the Damnonii dwelled in the deep valleys hidden between the Caledonian mountains, and were therefore known as the “Deep Ones.” While it is uncertain, their name of “Deep Ones” may also refer to being miners of the plentiful pockets of ore which can be found inside those great mountains. Set both between the mountains and on the coast of the Hibernian Sea, these people benefitted from sourcing their own vital resources and then selling them abroad by ship, meaning that they were able to support themselves by means beyond simple conquest and destruction. They were builders of civilization and structure, owing to the fact that they would later combine with the Hibernian Scotti peoples to form the kingdom of Strathclyde, the beginning of the Scottish people and ‘Scotland.’"
 ###Taexalia
 taexalia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Taexali"
 taexalia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the Caledonian tribes, possibly a people who would be known as ‘Picts,’ the Taexali tribe lived on the eastern coast of the Caledonian region in the far north. Like others of their kin, they are said to have held their capital or political center atop a defensible promontory overlooking the sea - the Taexalon Promontory. Beyond this major settlement, they would have lived in small villages and hamlets dotting the coast and the thin valleys between the mountains."
 ###Caledonia
 caledonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Hard Feet"
 caledonia_heritage_desc:0 "The Caledonian Confederacy, possibly the same as a confederacy of the Picts, were similar to many of their neighboring tribes in that they largely built hill forts and farmed what little arable land existed between the tall mountains. Perhaps because of the rough nature of their home terrain, the name of these people meant those with a 'hard foot'. Besides their feet, they were described as red-haired and large-limbed, which had often been associated with the Germanic tribes. Though they were lowly farmers and hill-dwellers, they fiercely protected their homes and lands, and when the Mediterranean powers would come to challenge them, they would not submit and two great walls had to be built to contain their might."
 ###Cornavia
 cornavia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Horned Picts"
 cornavia_heritage_desc:0 "The Cornovii were the farthest of the Caledonian tribes in Britannia, living on the northern edge of the island. Their horizon was the northern seas and a site of the lands which only the gods had visited - perhaps frigid Hyperborea lay beyond. The only land known to be farther away from the lands of people was Thule, which was perhaps one of the distant islands - the Orcades, the modern Shetlands, the Faroe islands, Iceland itself, or even Scandinavia. The Caithness Cornovii may have taken their name from the similar horned origin as the Cornovii of southern Britannia - they were the horned people at the edge of the world."
 ###Carnonacia
 carnonacia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Carnonacae"
 carnonacia_heritage_desc:0 "The second-most northern peoples of Caledonia and of greater Britannia, the Carnonacae inhabited the north-western coast as well as parts of neighboring islands where lowlands afforded better living and the coast offered fishing. This spread out nature and low density encouraged constant travel by boat between the islands for communication and trade."
 ###Monapia
 monapia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Isle in the Middle"
 monapia_heritage_desc:0 "The people of the isle between Britannia, the region of Caledonia, and little-known Hibernia knew the trade of ship travel and the trade relations which came with their transitory position - the Romans would call this place Manavia. This island has been home to people since 6,500 BCE and while the people would come to call it a name just meaning ‘the island,’ it is also said to have gotten its name of Monavia/Mann/Man/Manu/Mona from several sources. One was Manannan, a king of the otherworld of Celtic mythology, while another was a famous merchant known as Manannan, who resided there. These two origins speak to both the trading importance of the island as well as the mystic nature of it as a strange mountain jutting out of the sea far away from other tribes. It is said that the god Manannan held his cloak over the island, protecting it from invaders while also mystifying the place - this may be why so many strange and awe-inspiring creatures and beings are said in myth and legend to come from this place, such as the Buggane or the fairies who supposedly live in their rocky homes there."

## Hibernian Heritages
 ###Ivernia
 ivernia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Iron Hibernia"
 ivernia_heritage_desc:0 "The Iverni tribe which, to foreigners, gave their name to both the 'city' of Ivernia and the island of Hibernia, was the southwesternmost of all the tribes on the large isle west of Britannia. To their own, they were known as the Erainn, ruled by the dynasties of Dairine - these had been a warrior caste and one of the only three warrior-races in Hibernia. They ruled with an iron fist and were feared by their own people."
 ###Usdia
 usdia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Usdiae"
 usdia_heritage_desc:0 "Living around the rivers Dabrona and Birgu in the southern promontory of Hibernia, the Usdiae shared a western neighbor in the Iveni, one of the more powerful, unpredictable, and traditionionally cruel tribes on the island. The Usdiae themselves may have also been members of the group of Celts known as the Laigin, who came over to Hibernia and colonized the southeastern coast as early as around 600 BCE."
 ###Brigantes
 brigantes_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Hibernian High Ones"
 brigantes_heritage_desc:0 "Either a separate people entirely or a break-off group of the large confederation of Brigantes tribes in central Britannia, the Brigantes in Hibernia may have formed their connection to the mainland with their heritage of worship. The Irish goddess Brigid was the counterpart and equivalent of Brigantia, and would indicate a shared naming convention between these two tribes, as well as a shared worship of the ‘high one’ and victory. It is unclear, but some believe that this tribe was the ancestor of either the Ui Bairrche or Ui Brigte clan, again maintaining a possible etymological connection to Brigid and Brigantia."
 ###Coriondia
 coriondia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Hibernian Army"
 coriondia_heritage_desc:0 "The name of the Coriondi may simply have meant the “army,” or the “people under arms,” giving them a foreboding and fearsome reputation even in name. They were situated close to the modern Welsh coast, being able to send trading ships and migrants with ease. Perhaps their ability to spread far and propagate is why some believe their tribe survived in the form of successful pre-Christian through Christian era tribes in the southeast coast. Or, perhaps, the implications of their conquest maintained their presence on the island."
 ###Gangania
 gangania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sionainn"
 gangania_heritage_desc:0 "Two iterations of this tribe supposedly lived in western modern Wales and then in Hibernia - the connection, however, is uncertain. The Gangani lived along the river Sionainn, which is both the longest river in the Pretannic isles as well as being named after the goddess Sionna - she is the meaning of 'possessing wisdom'. The river is one of seven which supposedly leads to the well of wisdom in the Celtic Otherworld that is surrounded by nine hazel trees. It is said that the granddaughter of the god Lir, Sionna herself, was drowned here, and so gave it her name."
 ###Manapia
 manapia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Hibernian Manapii"
 manapia_heritage_desc:0 "The Manapii of Hibernia, like their similarly named counterparts in Gaul or even on the island of Mona, may have taken their name from their high-elevation home - they lived in the eastern highlands of Hibernia, which gave a greater defensible position to the tribal settlements. They made up a part of the Laigin people of the modern Leinster region, who themselves held a migratory origin in Hibernia, sailing over from either Britannia or Gaul as early as 600 BCE. Like several other tribes, however, they also moved around with many clans traveling north and spreading their people over the eastern coast of the isle. Perhaps all of Hibernia will become their isle, their mountain in the sea."
 ###Auteinia
 auteinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Autenii"
 auteinia_heritage_desc:0 "Though they lived in the west of Hibernia, the Autenii have also been recorded having settlements in the east with many migrants preferring the shore with closer contact to Britannia. Their lands were home to some of the largest lakes in Hibernia which provided both fresh water, irrigation, and food. Along with this wealth of water-sources, the area maintained a very mild and livable climate which rarely saw high temperatures, making settlement easier."
 ###Nagnatia
 nagnatia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Distinguished Hibernians"
 nagnatia_heritage_desc:0 "Also called the Magnatae, the Nagnatae were some of the oldest peoples in modern Connacht, leading lives of long-made tradition. They may have been the ancestors of the Fir Ol nEcmacht, who likewise claim to be the prehistoric inhabitants of their region. Their tribal center, or at least a great settlement, was named Nagata after the tribe and could be found between the mouths of the rivers Ravius and Libnius. This place was given the label of ‘distinguished’ by the Mediterranean peoples, and therefore must have held great physical and trade importance to garner the attention of the city-builders to the south."
 ###Caucia
 caucia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Cauci"
 caucia_heritage_desc:0 "Settled around modern Dublin, where the Norse viking-people would raid and then colonize, the Cauci may have had a closer tie to the Germanic peoples than this locational coincidence. Their name possesses a similarity to the Germanic Chauci in the ‘Low Countries’ and north-west Germany, which even the ancient authors noticed and questioned. This coincidence, along with that of the neighboring Manapii and their continental counterparts, led some to believe in a greater relation and movement of peoples across the channels and seas. Perhaps the Pretannic isles were truly a refuge for all tribal groups fleeing the onset of Roman domination, be they from Hispania, Gaul, or Germania. The descendants of this tribe may be the Ui Cuaich and/or the Cuachraige of the modern Dublin area."
 ###Eblania
 eblania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Eblani"
 eblania_heritage_desc:0 "Living north of the area of modern Dublin, which takes its name from the meaning of ‘a dark pool,’ possibly a tidal pool or a swampy marsh which spawned tales of fear and mystery. This tribe had a settlement aptly named Eblana around the rivers Buvinda and Oboca. Even the name of the Eblani may have survived in the modern area name of Edmann. This site had a strong trading relation with the powers in Britannia, which the Romans would later send goods to for natural resources in return."
 ###Venicnia
 venicnia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Hibernian Hunters"
 venicnia_heritage_desc:0 "Living in the northwestern reaches of Hibernia, the Venicnii grew in a well-wooded area and were therefore known  as the hunters of the forests, being related to the later Feni and other hunting tribes in the area which profited off of selling game and furs. Separated from their neighbors by both the extensive forests and the hill-lines, the Venicnii were isolated and some say more wild than those around them."
 ###Voluntia
 voluntia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Voluntii"
 voluntia_heritage_desc:0 "Settled in the later-known region of Ulster which spawned many tales in the Ulster mythological cycle, the Voluntii, who may have also been called the Uoluntii and gave their name to the Ulaid area, took their name from the meaning of ‘bearded.’ The settled Voluntii lived in the southern part of this region around the rivers Lagan and Boyne. Evidence that many of the settlements contained skilled metalworkers has been found in their remains - their access to the sea and the far shores of Britannia would have opened these metalworkers up to foreign Celtic markets."
 ###Darinia
 darinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Daire"
 darinia_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly meaning the people of ‘tumult’ or ‘rage’ with their name, the tribe of the Darnii could be traced back to the legendary Daire, the dynasts and heroes of old Hibernia before the Mediterranean powers came to know the isle. Due to their aggression and the importance of rage, the Darnii may have been considered the descendants of a ‘red god’ of war and harsh emotions. It is possible that these people became the Scotti tribesmen to sail over to Britannia and establish the kingdom of Dal Riata and eventually Scotland."
 ###Robogdia
 robogdia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Robogdii"
 robogdia_heritage_desc:0 "The Robogdii inhabited the most northeastern part of Hibernia in the same area as the mythological kingdom/region of Dal nAraidi - the large freshwater lake of Lough Neagh bordered this place, providing fertility to the soil and drinking water bot for the people and a body of wildlife. Their closeness to the islands and promontories of southern Caledonia and Britannia allowed for great levels of trade and migration between the opposing shores, allowing for the transfer of ideas and customs. This location gave the Robogdii many options for foreign relations… or conquest."
 zealot_heritage:0 "Zealot Heritage"
 zealot_heritage_desc:0 "The Zealots were Judean radicals who advocated for an end to the rule of foreigners. Their especially militant branch, the sicarii were known for performing political assassination with sicae - knives - hidden in their cloaks before disappearing back into the crowds, as well as acting as bandits attacking travelers seen as supporting foreign rule."

## Burmese Heritages
 ###Arakan
 arakan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Indianized Argyre"
 arakan_heritage_desc:0 "Looking out over the Bay of Bengal and watched over by the Arakan mountains, the land of Arakan, possibly the homeland of the Rhakine people of old, sits as a benefactor of coastal trade and a contractor of outside influences. This region was one of the first in Southeast Asia to adopt Dharmic religions and, based on inscriptions found there, may have held a large Vedic community, adopting traditions and customs of peoples from the delta of the Ganges. While the Mediterranean peoples knew the capital as Argyre, those members of the Indian subcontinent may have had a more Indianized term on account of the fact that Arakan may have been an Indianized Kingdom at one point, serving as a passageway for Buddhist monks from the Mauryan Empire. Yet, more than for religious transfer, Arakan facilitated the passage of goods from India and further west to South and Eastern Asian markets including the kingdoms of China."
 ###Fugandulu
 fugandulu_heritage:0 "Pyu Doorway Heritage"
 fugandulu_heritage_desc:0 "Known by the Chinese as border state to the larger area of Pyu people known as the Xinanyi or ''southwestern barbarians'', the people of Fugandulu stood in the path of a large and untapped trade corridor that ran the interior of Southeast Asia and stood as an alternative to the longer naval route that passed through the Strait of Malacca. Apparently, this route had been untameable to all larger empires. The state of Fugandulu may have also been known to the Vedic writing in Sanskrit as ''Pugramadvara'', or the ''doorway to the land of the Pyu.'' Its capital, Sri Kestra, was one of if not the largest and greatest cities of pre-Angkor times and the name of the city meant ''Field of Fortune/Glory,'' giving an impression of the bounty and fertility that happened upon its inhabitants. Loose legends claim a descendancy from the Tanguang Kingdom to the north, with two Tanguang scions finding and claiming the land for their own rule."
 ###Beikthano
 beikthano_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pan Hwar"
 beikthano_heritage_desc:0 "Legends tell how Beikthano was founded and ruled first by the queen regent, Pan Htwar, a daughter of both the dynasty of the Tanguang Kingdom and the Ogress-nymph of the island called Lanka Dipa. Yet, the royal origin of the state came with royal consequences, because, at a later time, king Duttabaung of the Sri Ksetra in Fugandulu came to Beikthano with a great army and sacked it. He abducted the princess Pan Htwar and took her away to his royal residence in his homeland, marrying her while he kept her in captivity. The city itself seems to have been a namesake for the Vedic god Vishnu, indicating a connection with the Dharmic religions and strong contact with the Vedic kingdoms to the west in the Indian subcontinent proper."
 ###Beinnaka
 beinnaka_heritage:0 "Heritage of Golden Power"
 beinnaka_heritage_desc:0 "Located in the Kyauske region, the city of Binnaka itself shared much in its cultural style and construction to other Pyu-culture settlements along the transversable route. However, the site of this settlement was well-endowed with rich minerals and metals, and precious stones dotted the homes of the wealthy, bearing the image of elephants, turtles, lions and the like. Early Pyu-script inscriptions have been found on the pottery and jewelry at the site, with gold and silver baubles everywhere. It is said that only the power of Binnaka was strong enough to topple the long-standing reign and supremacy of the Tanguang Kingdom in the north, and so it held a special reverence amongst all the Pyu city-states and their peoples."
 ###Halin
 halin_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sarvastivada Fearmongers"
 halin_heritage_desc:0 "Founded within the dry zone of Ayeyarwady River Basin, the crops of Halin stood to gain much from the flow of the main river and its many tributaries as they fertilized the irrigated fields. Its Tibeto-Burman speakers, however, were not simply just farmers, and while they worshiped Bon principles, many of the younger individuals were open to the study of the Sarvastivada school of Buddhism. They sent their merchants and amateur traders down to Sri Ksetra, where greater markets could be found, but had a good bounty in their own native lands. The site itself has long been threatened with prophecy of godly disaster in natural form, with storms and strange happenings seen as possible consequences of misfortune rather than progress of the natural order of things."
 ###Tanguang
 taguang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pyu Primacy"
 taguang_heritage_desc:0 "Thought by some to have been the first Burmese monarchy, the dynasty of Tanguang does have its legendary tendrils threaded into the origin-story of many of its southern Pyu-culture neighbors. Some persistent rumors even boast to claim that Tanguang was founded by the very own Sakya clan of Buddha, lending credence to their welcoming of Buddhists. Yet, these things may be a social memory of the migrations of the Tibeto-Burman speakers who came down from the heights long before and first settled in the north of what would become a long north-south corridor of Pyu city-states. The relics of Tanguang say as much, providing evidence of influences from outside the typical Pyu cultural continuum, setting up Tanguang as a gateway, or entranceway, from the outside and the past into the lives of the Pyu-peoples."
 ###Shan
 shan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Entertainers"
 shan_heritage_desc:0 "Ancestors of the modern Shan tribes living in Myanmar, the ancient Shan were a well-connected group in the Asian south. While they held diplomatic connections with Imperial China in the east, they were adept in coming into possession of rare goods and unique individuals whose origins were in the west, the likes of India or Persia or other far-off lands. The Shan were also known for their unique entertainers, such as dwarvish artists who spat and swallowed fire while juggling balls and amazing the crowds. Such unique contributions to their Chinese neighbors ingratiated the Shan with foreign courts and rulers, adding prestige to their own king and his subordinates. Such was the way the Shan made a name and a respect for themselves, providing luxury and ecstasy to others."
###Nyaunggan
 nyaunggan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Bronze Neolithic Exchange"
 nyaunggan_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since at least around 1,500 BCE, the site of Nyaunggan has proven it was not the richest of places, with grave goods in its peoples' burials being simpler and less luxurious, but there is a clear indication of a pre-Iron Age culture which used stone tools and a few individual bronze pieces, having mortuary rites involving communal eating/drinking and offerings for the dead. They seem to have learned the process of smelting bronze out of local tin deposits when the technology traveled down the Neolithic exchange routes - after which it became a dominant component in the mortuary practices at the site."
###Hnaw Kan
 hnaw_kan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Hnaw Kan"
 hnaw_kan_heritage_desc:0 "One of the settlements in the Samon Valley, Hnaw Kan exhibited the cultural infusion and metamorphosis that the Pyu people imposed up it and other settlements with the introduction of carnelian beads as a sign of new trade and influences, and swords and spears as a sign of confrontation caused by the competing interests and values different cultures have against one another. With how prosperous the valley was, isolationism was not an option and the people of Hnaw Kan were forced to adapt to newcomers all the time who wished to settle on fertile soil."
###Taungthaman
 taungthaman_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Salt-Buyers"
 taungthaman_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Taungthaman relied on the salt provided by mines around Halin, and buried their dead within the confines of their villages. They were protective of their own and kept to themselves in times of uncertainty, but relied on foreign input for their way of life to survive as newcomers would pour into the Samon valley. "
###Ywa Htin Kon
 ywa_htin_kon_heritage:0 "Heritage of Ywa Htin Kon"
 ywa_htin_kon_heritage_desc:0 "These people were able to extract the wealth from their land, both in the fields and in the rocks, to their ultimate benefit - piles of agate, quartz, and bronze were theirs when all was said and done, and their people could dine on excessive quantities of rice which their agricultural sector provided. They were well off in comparison to their neighbors, and able to wear their wealth as bracelets, anklets, and decorate their villages with bronze bells. They were able to withstand the cultural changes that ensued with the arrival of northerners, and even prosper from the added manpower."

## Illyrian Heritages
 ###Abria
 abria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mead-Makers"
 abria_heritage_desc:0 "What is known best of the Abroi was that they were famed for their mead. This was made from the sweetest of honeys, and would be paired well with pastries or sweet treats. Found around the Mat and Drin valleys, the Abroi, possibly also having been called the Arboi, were the northern neighbors of the infamous Taulantii, or may have been a northern tribe of the greater Taulantii people."
###Armistia
 armistia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Armistae"
 armistia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the component tribes that make up the greater Illyrian group known as the Deramestae, the Armistae could be found in the far hinterland from the perspective of the city of Epidaurum. Because they inhabited the mountain passes that separated the Illyrian coast from the inner plains, they controlled a good deal of the trade that crossed the cold, narrow corridors."
###Armistia
 armistia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Armistae"
 armistia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the component tribes that make up the greater Illyrian group known as the Deramestae, the Armistae could be found in the far hinterland from the perspective of the city of Epidaurum. Because they inhabited the mountain passes that separated the Illyrian coast from the inner plains, they controlled a good deal of the trade that crossed the cold, narrow corridors."
###Oxuaioia
 oxuaioia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Oxuaioi"
 oxuaioia_heritage_desc:0 "The tribe in control of the Drinus river, a tributary of the great Istros riverway, as it splits into the smaller Tara and Lim streams before disappearing up in the mountains, the Oxuaioi, also known as the Ozuaei, were a trading member of the greater tribal grouping known as the Deramestae in Illyria. They controlled the more advantageous and northern route over the Illyrian mountain range, and thus earned a greater share of trade-control than their neighbors, the Armistae."
###Daorsia
 daorsia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Cyclopean Illyrians"
 daorsia_heritage_desc:0 "Rivals of the Delmatae tribe, the Daorsi were coastal traders and raiders that found themselves often at the mercy of greater tribal powers. Their capital of Daorson facilitated much of the tribe's hellenization, as it was a haven for many prominent Greek traders. Like the Greek cities, the town itself was a fortress in its own right, surrounded by cyclopean walls and crowned with an acropolis which housed important buildings of officials and grand public venues. The site had been thus guarded since the Bronze Age, a long-inhabited center of coastal culture."
###Epidaurum
 epidaurum_heritage:0 "Heritage of Zaptal"
 epidaurum_heritage_desc:0 "Founded sometime in the 6th century BCE, Epidauros was one of the earlier Archaic/Classical Greek colonies to breach the Illyrian frontier and establish formal communications with the men and women who were considered barbarians in that region. Not to be confused with the infamous Epidamnus, another Greek city in Illyria which some attribute as a causing factor of the Peloponnesian War, Epidauros was a place of more civil contact and trade. The Illyrians who lived there called it Zaptal."
###Pieria
 pieria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pleraei"
 pieria_heritage_desc:0 "Living along the river called Naro, the Pleraei tribe (sometimes called the Pieri, among many other names), were well-accustomed to the presence and influence of Greek city-dwellers. Near the Pleraei live Knidian settlers in small coastal towns and the Korkyrans in Issa. The Greeks take an interest in them and their land because of its rich, fertile nature, watered by the river, and so they conduct much trade and learn the Greek tongue to make transactions easier. This is why the Greeks set up emporions in Narona, to have easier land-access."
###Issa
 issa_heritage:0 "Heritage of Dionysius' Illyria"
 issa_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse in the 4th century BCE, the Greek colony of Issa controlled a set of valuable islands on the Illyrian coast which controlled trade on the Adriatic. The colony competed with the Liburni tribes for dominance among the islands, but was able to hold its own with Hellenistic walls and a robust coin-minting system to consolidate their trading power as an independent city-state."
###Delmatia
 delmatia_heritage:0 "Heritage Armatus's Raiders"
 delmatia_heritage_desc:0 "Mostly herdsmen by trade, the Delmatae tribes-people were more primitive than their neighbors except for the case of weapons - in this regard they were well ahead of their kindred tribes. As mostly pastoral people, they worshiped the god Sylvanus (calling him Vidasus), and paired him with their native goddess Thana for a wife. Besides these, their focus was on war-cults and the war-god Armatus and his kin. Small Celtic influences have been found in their city of Delminium, which has roots tracing back to the Bronze Age."
###Deuria
 deuria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Deuri"
 deuria_heritage_desc:0 "Living off the river covered in willows, the Deuri (sometimes called the Derrioi or Derbanoi) control one of the more open and easier-to-navigate passages across the Illyrian mountain range. Theirs is a more forested and fertile land with waters full of Flying Fish and Istros Salmon. They feed equally off of these as they do the wealthy trade that comes from the coastal tribes and heads through their paths towards the interior markets. Pinned in by mountains, expansion is not an easy prospect for them, yet being invaded would prove a challenge as well."
###Ditionia
 ditionia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ditiones"
 ditionia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the Pannonian-based Illyrian tribes, the Ditiones resided both inside the protective mountain valleys and the well-fortified citadel inside their capital of Splonum - a well-geared army would have trouble taking this place by storm even in the greatest weather. Thus, the Ditiones were a fierce and self-preserving people who feared incursions by invaders but were well prepared for the possibility. The gods have mercy on any who would assault their home."
###Libernia
 libernia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Liburni"
 libernia_heritage_desc:0 "Spread all along the coast, including even the island of Korkyra, recorded as early as the 8th century BCE, the Liburni tribal group (composed of sub-tribes such as the Mentores, Hymanes, and Peucetias) may have been around since the Bronze Age. An antagonistic and expansionist people, the Liburni controlled and hopped between many of the Adriatic islands, raiding or conquering local ports and having to be expelled by the Greeks or their neighbors with much effort. Only Syracuse's naval power could contain them to their ethnic homelands. They traded and raided widely, collecting coins and treasures from Italy, North Africa, Greece, and beyond, and one of their chief deities was Taranucus."
###Iapodia
 iapodia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Iapodes"
 iapodia_heritage_desc:0 "North and inland of the Liburnians lived the Iapodes/Iapydes, whose country was fed by the rivers called Colapis and Oeneus, and whose protection was afforded by Mons Baebius. Reaching their territorial apex between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE with several forays into inland settlements, their identity became rather mixed with the wide adoption of Liburni, inland Celtic, Greek, and Istrian/Venetic qualities which continue to confuse scholars who attempt to identify their sites. Using Celtic tattoos and weapons, they protected and expanded small millet fields which sustained their distant villages. Their tribal totem was the horse, but they also worshiped holy snakes."
###Chersos
 chersos_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Barren Cliff"
 chersos_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, Chersos (modern Cres) island possibly takes its name from a proto-Indo-European root meaning 'cliff,' perhaps relating to its steep shoreline - however, the Greek 'Chersos' refers to a dry/barren land, which may also describe the island and its relative misfortune for settlement. The island could only be irrigated and fed drinkable fresh water from a singular lake, that of modern Vrana, so the largest harbor faces the nearby mainland and its coastline, where freshwater and better fortunes could likely be procured. A Greek trader came here only to enjoy the safety of a barren rock while he traded with the possibly-hostile Illyrians across the waves."
###Istria
 istria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Venetic Illyri"
 istria_heritage_desc:0 "A strange cousin to all their Illyrian kin, the Histri could be considered Venetic Illyri, speaking an Italicized dialect and taking their customs from the Italian peninsula. Their location and control of the Istrian peninsula made trade with the Veneti and other Italic tribes and towns on the west Adriatic beneficial for their local economies, so it is obvious that they would take after their richer trading partners. Protected by their coastal rock-faces and difficult-to-navigate waters, they could also employ piracy when trade did not fulfill their needs completely - raiding their Italic business partners was not out of the question."
 cimmerian_heritage:0 "Cimmerian Heritage"
 cimmerian_heritage_desc:0 "The Cimmerians, the first scourge of the Iranian Plateau, the Levant, and the Anatolian plains, were once the most widespread and feared steppe-group known in the world, only to later be supplanted by the Scythians. With an Iranian origin shrouded in the migration-secrecy all nomads who originally come from the east maintain, the Cimmerians inspired fear into their adversaries and were the best mercenaries and warlords. They were powerful enough to break the Kingdom of Phrygia and only declined into a humble people after their steam of conquest petered out following the death of Tugdammi. And while they may not have been in power forever, they destabilized the politics of the entirety of Asia, christening a new era."



 ### Illyrian Pirate
 illyrian_pirate_heritage: "Illyrian Pirate Heritage"
 illyrian_pirate_heritage_desc: "Given its reputation as a wild, ungovernable region, Illyria is the perfect place for the marauding pirate fleets to hide, so it comes as no surprise to hear that a dread nation of pirates now controls the Mare Adriaticum."
