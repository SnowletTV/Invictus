The Achaemenid Persian Empire had been sending Greek (mostly Ionian) exiles from their westernmost provinces to this northeastern border as a means of preventing further revolts, especially after the famed Ionian revolt which acted as prelude to the 1st Greco-Persian War. These Greeks were sent to a city known as Cyropolis on the lower bank of the Jaxartes, so named after the founder of the Achaemenid dynasty, which Alexander likely renamed to his furthest city upon his conquest of all of Persia. This place had become, especially with the extra Greeks settled by Alexander, a bastion of Hellenism in the area, in which the people would live off the fertile land, raise their famous “Heavenly Horses,” and would be integrated into the greater Greco-Bactrian society until invaders from the East came knocking."

They were conquered by the Achaemenids and were likely ruled from the capital of the Bactrian satrapy, but maintained an inherently-steppe warlike posture and found freedom during the weak rule of Artaxerxes. These people were both warriors and merchants, making the beginnings of the Silk Road through trading hubs such as what would become the well-known Samarkand. And before becoming embroiled in the Wars of the Diadochi, the last great moment in their land was the battle at the Sogdian Rock, a fortress marvel beheld by all the Greeks of the army of Alexander."

Fighting his way out of Anatolia, Xenophon recorded in his Anabasis that he and his 10,000 mercenaries got 'provisions in Trapezus by purchase, for the Trapezuntians provided us a market, and in return for the honors they bestowed upon us and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we paid them like honors; if any of the barbarians were their friends, we kept our hands off them, while upon their enemies, against whom they would themselves lead us, we wrought all the harm we could' (5.5.14)."

 kos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kos"
 kos_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the mythological autochthonous king Merops, Kos existed throughout ancient history as a place of wealth, learning, and luxury production. Freed from Persia's grip following the Greco-Persian Wars (later only shortly ruled by the Carian satrapy for a while), the island remained largely independent around the great Aegean leagues, Alexander's Empire, and the raging Diadochi, gaining a form of oligarchic self rule even while under the 'ownership' of the Ptolemies, who used it as a place for educating their dynasty. Kos also maintained a recognition for fine wine, a bevy of silk clothes, and the island's famous Asclepion."
 commagenian_heritage:0 "Commagenian Heritage"
 commagenian_heritage_desc:0 "The region of Commagene, while its pre-Hellenistic age history is blurry, appears to have a long and continuous footnote in history stretching all the way back to its time as a Syro-Hittite kingdom referred to in the 15th century BCE as "Kummaha", near identical with the later Archaic city of "Kummuh", thought to be the same site/city as Hellenistic Samosata, where the Attic poet Lucian supposedly came from. Existing possibly as a satrap of the Armenian Kingdom before being a province under the Seleucids, the area boasts a multicultural demographic, being a melting pot for Hellenic and Iranian cultures, best seen in the royal sanctuary on Mount Nemrut."
 bambyce_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Aramean Priest-Kings"
 bambyce_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the famous temple for its patron deity: Atargatis, Bambyce's history traces back to its annexation by the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BCE.

The city prospered under the yoke of Macedonian/Seleucid rule, becoming 'the place' to stop at between Antioch and Seleucia on the Tigris, eventually becoming the richest city in Roman Syria."

This tribe would soon spawn the line of Mithridates following the fall of Alexander's Empire, one of the staunchest thorns in the Roman Republic's side."

 kaukonia_heritage_desc:0 "It is hard to say where the Kaukones came from, or where they went. Some, like Homer, consider them an autochthonous group in Anatolia, while others consider the name to be referring to a Greek tribe, or a tribe having moved into Greece. For all intent and purposes, the Iliadic reference to Kaukones is used, and so they can say they were part of the great Trojan War - huzzah!"

However, Assyrian and Persian invasion and intervention led to the kingdom's decline, the recession of its borders and, at times, a total collapse of the governmental structures.

 ###Kaounos
 Kaunos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kaunos"
 Kaunos_heritage_desc:0 "While the material remains of Kaunos date its foundation or early site-use to at most the 9th century BCE, the traditional history of the city dates back to the namesake king Kaunos, son of King Miletus, founder of that city. It is said that Kaunos and his sister, Byblis, fell in love and that, in order to avoid incest, Kaunos fled her company all the way to Lycia in Anatolia. Here, Byblis followed him but fell into sorrow and madness and died, turning into a spring, crying her incessant tears over the land and creating with her watery eyes the river the Calbys river. In Asia, Kaunos married the nymph Pronoe and had a son, Aegialus, who founded a city nearby, named for his father. The city itself was an excellent trade harbor, having two functioning ports, and Herodotus notes that the people of the city resiliently fought against the Persian general Harpagus - they did, after a while, lose. The historian also notes that while he personally disagrees with their claim of their own foreign origin, because they speak a language similar to that of his own home, he cannot deny that they act in a peculiar manner, different from all the other Carians and Lycians. All the men, women, and even the children drink wine together."
 ###Physkos
 Physkos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Leto's Castle"
 Physkos_heritage_desc:0 "A trading port town, Physkos was known for two things. The first was that, high up, there was a great castle which Herodotus claims had been there since 3,000 BCE. Alexander the Great sieged this castle and the town itself, and when the inhabitants had fled, being unable to defend their number of 600 against him, he made a point of repairing and maintaining the tactical, imposing structure. It is also known that the town served as a worship site for Leto, mother goddess to the twins Apollo and Artemis. While many have claimed there is a sacred grove dedicated to her (which there may be), there is a well known cave hidden on a small island connected to the area around Physkos by a narrow isthmus. In this cave, Leto was indeed worshiped during the Greek period, but the remains there reveal site-use tracing back almost 12,000 years (10,000 BCE)."

It is said that the Libyan god Anti stood on top of the peaks as he challenged passers-bye and fought even Herakles. Perhaps they have inherited his titanic strength."
 ###Mauretania

 Mauretanian_heritage_desc:0 "The kingdom of the Mauri, Mauretania, later coming to refer to the region touching the the sea beyond the Pillars of Herakles (Mauretania Tingitana), but also the region next to it (Mauretania Caesariensis), was a confederation of hill-based tribes brought together under the power of a few ruling ‘familiae’. The Mauri were a blessing and a curse to the colonial powers in the Libyan and European continents, trading rich goods from the mountainous interior lands with outsiders while also raiding their settlements on occasion, even crossing the sea itself to raid the Iberian region of Baetica."
 ###Nectiberia

 Nectiberian_heritage_desc:0 "Settled at the foot of the Atlas mountain range, the Nectiberi can be found stuck between a rock and a hard place, literally, with two significant competitors in the notorious Autololes to their west and the raid-happy Mauri to their north. Their only means of escape, should an invasion or aggressive migration occur, would be through the mountains themselves. Luckily, they have the Pyrrhon Plain at their side, so sustenance is not one of their many problems."
 ###Autolalia
 Autolalian_heritage:0 "Autolalian Heritage"
 Autolalian_heritage_desc:0 "Strabo describes them as “the most powerful of the Libyan nations” while Pliny the Elder fears their ferocious nature. If it is to be believed that they once had Iarbas as their king, then Dido/Elissa and great Carthage too once feared their tribe because Iarbas was so aggressive a suitor of the Punic queen. While a Gaetulian tribe, the Autololes were more well known for their ravenous behavior, having fed on the flesh of terrible wild beasts."

 Daphnitaean_heritage_desc:0 "Spread farther away from the feet of mountains and too far from the shore, the Daphnitae are confined to the vast horizon of endless desert which expands seemingly forever in all directions. Perhaps one of them may see a lone camel passing by, a lost Garamantine warrior from ages past, riding by on an old chariot, or they might see any sort of torturous vision appear amidst the hot haze of the homogenous sands.

 Massylian_heritage_desc:0 "Most likely beginning as a few ‘familiae,’ the Massylii took over political and cultural control of many Numidian tribes during the process of becoming a protectorate state of Carthage, held together by the recognition of a great power and the intricacies of tribal segmentation and consolidation. Like all Numidian tribes, the Massylii were known for their tactics with the swift and powerful Numidian horses and cavalry divisions, which they used to serve both Carthage and other powers, and also to wage war on their Massaesyli counterparts.

Yet the main body of the Gaetulian tribes, on the border with and often mixing both biologically and culturally with the related Numidian tribes, has been notable for quite a few things. These include invading everyone around them, indiscriminately, trading their exotic and dangerous wildlife, such as the Gaetulian lion, off to Mediterranean powers for sport, and growing asparagus of a size greater than two men and thick as the reeds found in the marshes of Cyprus. So it has been that these people are a great threat to their neighbors, and a constant source of amazement."

It is said that there were many bees around the lake, and that the Gyzantes made good use of them, extracting immeasurable amounts of honey. It is also said that they painted themselves red and ate the flesh of monkeys which could be found, innumerable, among the hills.

The town, which lies on the Sububa river, was part of a trade network along the river with the inland settlement of Banasa and was also part of the expansive trade routes connecting north to Tingis at the Pillars of Herakles."
 ###Lixus
 Lixan_heritage:0 "Lixan Heritage"
 Lixan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by the Phoenicians sometime in the eighth century BCE, Lixus was a multicultural hub with a strong native Mauretanian population living in close-knit neighborhood structures alongside the Phoenician colonists and traders. By the Hellenistic period, the city notably relied a great deal on its export of fish in order to support its economy."
 ###Kuass
 Kuassan_heritage:0 "Kuassan Heritage"
 Kuassan_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Phoenicians at least as early as the seventh century BCE, Kuass, possibly coming from the Libyan 'Akwass', was notable for its wealth of salt pools and production factories. This colony acted as a secondary site to the main production houses at Gadir for a notable set of red-slip tableware produced in the forms of common items such as amphorae."
 ###Rusaddir
 Rusaddiran_heritage:0 "Rusaddiran Heritage"
 Rusaddiran_heritage_desc:0 "Rusaddir, “The mighty cape,” was an important sight for any Phoneician or Punic sailor on their way to the Iberian peninsula. The city had a naturally-made and well-defended harbor on account of the rocks forming the cape which it draws its name from. It was the easternmost of the colony system connecting to the Pillars of Herakles and within the influence of Iberian Gadir."
 ###Iol
 Iolan_heritage:0 "Iolan Heritage"
 Iolan_heritage_desc:0 "Established sometime either in the sixth or fifth century BCE, Iol, or the “Sandy Island,” was an islet port which became one of the most important Punic centers in the region, minting the first coins in Numidia. It was notably fortified by the third century and the images on its coins depicted the fish it would sell abroad."
 ###Ibasim
 Ibasim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Abandoned"
 Ibasim_heritage_desc:0 "The islands of Ibiza/Evissa and Formentera, Phoenician Yboshim and Roman Frumenteria, labeled as their own island chain by the Greeks. The Pityusae, or “rich in pines,” were a uniquely scarcely inhabited area when the Phoenician settlers and traders arrived as back-migrants in the eighth century BCE from other colonies on the coast of Iberia. These islands, unlike the the talayotic-culture-inhabited Balearic islands of Majorca and Menorca to the east, experienced a vanishing of their population or perhaps a mass-abandonment after the Bronze Age collapse up until Phoenician occupation. The Phoenicians settled over barely populated previous settlements, first establishing an outpost at a southern cove on Ibiza before building their main port at the site of Yboshim, the namesake city for the island. The Pityusae were important ports for any ships traveling the northern route of the Mediterranean Sea to and from the Iberian coast."
 ###Utica
 Utica_heritage:0 "Heritage of the First Colonizers"
 Utica_heritage_desc:0 "The first Phoenician colony in the western Mediterranean, founded near the end of the ninth century BCE, Utica was set up at a strong geo-economic position at the mouth of the Bagradas river and imported goods from all over the Phoenician sphere of influence, including Levantine-Phoenician, Nuragic, Greek, Tartessian, Villanovan (early Etruscan), and Libyan wares at its expansive port and also saw a great deal of trade run through its connected port town of Rus Eshmun “Cape Eshmun” when the Bagrada changed its natural course and the original river path silted over, locking Utica into an inland position. Utica maintained complete autonomy until around 540 BCE, when it came into political arrangements as a powerful ally of Carthage, though it still competed with the new Punic capital economically."
 ###Kerkouane
 Kerkouanan_heritage:0 "Kerkouanan Heritage"
 Kerkouanan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the first half of the sixth century BCE, Kerkouane largely produced dyes and garum, owing to the size of its fishing production centers, its commercial centers, and the salt mines. The city acted as a large and prosperous trade center, made more effective by its regularized city-planning grid structure. The main necropolis for the city contains burials with votive goods ranging from foreign locations as far as Egypt."
 ###Hadrametum
 Hadrametan_heritage:0 "Hadrametan Heritage"
 Hadrametan_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by Tyrian settlers in the very late ninth century BCE, Hadrametum, its original name most likely meaning “south” or “southern place,” was more of a civil center of Phoenician occupation rather than a commercial center such as the many trade ports lining the north African coast which retained smaller populations but emphasized the exporting of luxury and exotic resources from interior trading and mining. This was accompanied by its well laid out building planning and the incorporation of a tophet for socio-religious use, as was characteristic in the major urban centers of colonial Phoenicia. In 310 BCE, Hadrametum was briefly captured by Agathocles of Syracuse near the end of the 7th Sicilian War, but was released when the Sicilians could not effectively keep the warfront in Africa after a long campaign of attrition and returned to Sicily where peace arrangements were soon drawn up."
 ###Leptis Minor
 Leptis_Minor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Leptis Minor"
 Leptis_Minor_heritage_desc:0 "Settled by Tyrian merchants, Leptis Minor (Roman Leptis Parva), not to be confused with Leptis Magna (greater Leptis) farther south, possibly meant “construction” or “naval station” in the original Phoenician, inscribed LPQ and sometimes LPQY in the semitic triliteral root system abbreviation. While it came under the socio-political domination of Carthage like the rest of most of North Africa, Leptis Minor maintained its wealthy status and in later periods was noted for paying a daily tribute of 1 Attic Talent, almost 60 pounds of pure silver."
 ###Thapsus
 Thapsan_heritage:0 "Thapsan Heritage"
 Thapsan_heritage_desc:0 "Bearing in its name the native Libyan prefix 'tha-' but a typical Phoenician/Punic ending, the settlement maye have been a native site later taken over by the Phoenicians as had happened at multiple towns across much of Africa. Set upon a defensible promontory near a wealth of salt flats for mining, Thapsus was set up as a commercial center and a waystation for merchant ships en-route to the Iberian and Atlantic coasts."
 ###Achola
 Acholan_heritage:0 "Acholan Heritage"
 Acholan_heritage_desc:0 "A colony founded by Carthaginians from Melite, Achola/Acholla was built on the northern coast of the Lesser Syrtis bay and retained several unique aspects of native Miletan culture, such as inhumation burials, as opposed to the typical Punic tradition of cremation burials. The nearby island of Cercinna served as a strong look-out post for naval activity in the bay and hosted small settlements of native and Phoenician types. Perhaps these people took advantage of the octopus hunting grounds surrounding the Cercinna archipelago."
 ###Emporia
 Emporia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kohanim and the Lotus Eaters"
 Emporia_heritage_desc:0 "Likely coming from the Greek ‘emporion’ or trading post, the region of Emporia, while not quite clear in the ancient sources, seems to have encompassed several rich Phoenician/Punic trading outposts and merchant cities. The area was also quite fertile, supplied by the Lesser Syrtis and its connected rivers, and the nearby lake Tritonis. Ancient Takapes, a native Libyan name possibly alluding to the site's pre-Phoenician origin, was noted for its local springs which provided for many farmers and cultivators. But there was a more alluring nature to Emporia. It is said that the island of Meninx, not far offshore from the town of Gergis, was the spot at which Odysseus landed during his famous voyage, and that it was once lived upon solely by the native Gindanes, who ate the lotus which deprives men of all ambition but the consumption of the flower. Even stranger, there also exists a legend on the island among the small Jewish community that, when Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the temple of Solomon, many in the Kohanim priestly-cast of society in flew the holy city for the shores of Meninx and brought with them the door to the temple itself and several foundation stones. However, many claims are laid regarding the island and, too, all of Libya."
 ###Tripolitania
 Tripolitanian_heritage:0 "Tripolitanian Heritage"
 Tripolitanian_heritage_desc:0 "Tripolitania was a region known for three cities, Sabratha, Leptis Magna, and Oyat (Greek Oea). Established during the archaic period and most likely over the foundations of native Libyan villages set in prosperous geographical positions, these cities sat at the periphery of Carthaginian control of eastern North Africa, and any hold of a people over the area was tenuous when considering not only the powerful cultures along the Nile and in Cyrenaica, but also the many nomadic tribes, including the well-feared Garamantes, which were equally capable of both raiding and trading. This tenuous hold was proven when the Greek rulers from Cyrenaica took hold of Oyat the original Phoenician colonists and referred to it as the Greek Oea before the Carthaginians retook it and incorporated it into their sphere of control."
## East African Heritages
###Dodekaschoinos
 Dodekaschoinos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Religious Peace"
 Dodekaschoinos_heritage_desc:0 "A frontier state serving as a cultural and political buffer between a Greek Egypt waiting and aKushite/Nubian Meroe waiting to take advantage of the cultural dilemma in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Dodekaschoinos, or the 12 cities, is meant to help integrate and pacify the upper Egyptian, Nubian, and Greek populations which did not appreciate the volatile nature of thise flipflopping region. The ancient temples built in the area, especially the one at Philae, dedicated to Isis, were the main focus for the activities of the garrison regent, with officials beginning a tradition of giving all the income of the 12 cities to the temples of both Egyptian and Nubian gods such as that of Mandulis. This buffer state allows for continuous long-distance trade along the Nile between the Nubian world and the connected Red Sea and the Mediterranean itself, which would result in many exotic goods and war elephants find their way up through the 12 cities and into upper and lower Egypt while Greek wine, and other Near Eastern goods came into Kushite hands."
###Blemmia
 Blemmian_heritage:0 "Blemmian Heritage"
 Blemmian_heritage_desc:0 "It is known from writings that the Blemmyes existed at least as early as the Nubian king Anlamani in the 7th century BCE, but they are likely far older, having been continuous inhabitants of the desert-laden region east of the Nile and on the coast of the Red Sea. Influenced by a mixture of Egyptian and Meroitic cultures, the Blemmyes, at a time, worshiped well-known gods like Isis at Philae as well as southern divinities like Mandulis at Kalabsha. While outsiders have often referred to the Blemmyes as nomadic raiders, they controlled wealthy gold mines and mineral-rich regions and built many well-fortified and prosperous cities which may have housed a royal king or two."
###Alut
 Alut_heritage:0 "Alutan Heritage"
 Alut_heritage_desc:0 "Beginning at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, Alut has the benefit of Nile trade networks, the floodplains bringing a richness to the landscape, and the wealth of the mineral and metal deposits in the east which serve to be exported to Northern aristocracies such as the Kushites or the Macedonians in Ptolemaic Egypt. Possibly taking up the area as early as the 4th century BCE, the people of Alut came into regular conflict with the declining Kushite kingdom, as the land was desirable to all interested parties."
###Moya
 Moyan_heritage:0 "Moyan Heritage"
 Moyan_heritage_desc:0 "Jebel-Moya, the site which the sphere of all Moyan culture surrounds, can be found in a quite old and well-trodden great plain hemmed in by massifs (compact mountain chains). With a great floodplain created by the Blue Nile and a unique freshwater source replenished by both the White and Blue Niles, Jebel Moya and Moya at large have been able to support pastoral communities for millenia, with massive grave sites belonging to shepherds long past."
###Boras
 Borasan_heritage:0 "Borasan Heritage"
 Borasan_heritage_desc:0 "Centered around the watercourse of the Black Nile which branches off from the main Nile as it bends and then turns and winds its way up into the mountains, Boras survives as a thriving avenue of exotic trade. It is both connected to Kush and Egypt and, by extension, the Mediterranean sphere in the north, as well as the Axumite/Arabian conjunction near the entrance of the Red Sea. While the people may be seen by outsiders as uncivilized barbarians, those same outsiders are quite happy to import Boras elephants and rich metals in quite large quantities."
###Aksum
 Axumite_heritage:0 "Aethiopian-Sabaean Heritage"
 Axumite_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly born from the declining D`mt kingdom, Aksum grew to power as a centralized mixture of native Aetheopian and trade-induced Sabaean and South Arabian influences. This mixture of cultures led to monumental buildings worshiping different or mixed gods, and would lead to uniquely Axumite Semitic language. Aksum was also a major center for trade and resource distribution. Much of the ivory or elephants and rhinoceroses reaped from inland habits would wind up in Aksum before flowing out to the nearby ports like Adulis."
###Adoulia
 Adoulian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Island"
 Adoulian_heritage_desc:0 "Notably established by law, Adulis was a market port on the Red Sea, set opposite of the notable “Mountain Island,” which ships harbor at for safety. Possibly having gained its independence during the Classical Period with the disappearance of the D`mt kingdom in the 5th century BCE, the port town which may have once been a simple emporion became a much more popular trade city in a profitable location. It exported in great amounts both ivory and slaves, and was said to have been frequented most by the troglodytae and aethiopian natives from the interior lands."
###Gwanara
 Gwanaran_heritage:0 "Gwanaran Heritage"
 Gwanaran_heritage_desc:0 "Surrounded by mountains and forests fed by the source of the Black Nile which branches off eastwards of the main Nile river, Gwanara is home to the peoples the Mediterranean civilizations considered Troglodytae, cave-goers, Aethiopians, or Calf-Eaters, because they were seen as strange and oftentimes savage, hiding among the forests and exotic landscapes of southernmost known lands of greater Libya. Yet, it is from these lands and these people that the many riches of the area are produced and eventually end up in the hands of Macedonian aristocrats. This fact cannot be denied."
###Yeha
 Yehan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Timber-Frame Builders"
 Yehan_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly the capital of the old Somalian-Sabaean D`mt kingdom which disappeared from record in the 5th century BCE, Yeha was the site of at least one great palace and a temple dedicated to the Sabaean Moon God, Almaqah. The palace stands as one of if not the earliest timber-framed buildings in Eastern Africa, attesting to the master craftsmanship of the people living there. The city in which these monumental builds can be found nestled in a fertile valley, protected by protective mountains."
###Avalitia
 Avalitian_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Little but the Good"
 Avalitian_heritage_desc:0 "Closest in travel to the Arabian shores on the opposite side of the Red Sea, Avalites was a port town which traded goods in small quantities but in great quality. This was especially the case when it came to Myrrh, that useful resin which flavors meals and covers the well-made product of the master carpenter. Those wishing to travel to Avalites had to do so by raft or boat, and those finding themselves in Avalites and wishing to leave had to do the same. This was especially true when it came to the frequent trade with the nearby Arabian town of Muza."
###Mundus
 Mundus_heritage:0 "Mocrotun Heritage"
 Mundus_heritage_desc:0 "One of the many city states which became an independent polity following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Mundus was larger in size than more periphery market towns, on the level of its westward neighbor, Malao. The port protected the harbored ships well, but may not have kept their sailors safe since the environment there has been considered ‘quarrelsome.’ Yet, while it imported many goods from all over, Mundus was best known for exporting a unique incense known as mocrotu, which was of better quality than the incense exported by the famous town of Mosylon, owner of the desirable Mosyllitic cinnamon."
###Opone
 Opone_heritage:0 "Crown of the Horn Heritage"
 Opone_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the tip of the Horn of Africa, Opone was one of the most well known cities with a port connecting the trade from India to the Red Sea, Egypt, and beyond. A city state having found independent rule following the collapse of the Macrobian kingdom, Opone had always been a part of an incredibly rich history of cultural connection. In its graves lie relics of the ancient Mycenaeans as well as goods from all over the east and west. As for its own work, it was known to produce the greatest amount of cinnamon of any of the Somalian coastal cities, and it was known for having the greatest quality of tortoiseshell-wares in its markets."
###Elaia
 Elaian_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pearls"
 Elaian_heritage_desc:0 "These sandy outcrops dotting the Red Sea seem at first to hold no importance but, in truth, the people living there hold in their control a great deal of wealth, famous throughout the sea itself. What comes from these islands, sold by the so-called “Fish-Eaters,” for obvious reasons, are pearls in the hundreds and quality tortoiseshell and other marine-based wares. These products are what make the Alalaiou islands well-known, and they are favored by their proximity to the trading port of Adulis on the Libyan shore."
## Arabian Heritages
###Lihyan
 Lihyan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Caravan Lords"
 Lihyan_heritage_desc:0 "An ancient kingdom stretching a large range of Arabia Felix, Lihyan served as an entity in its own right as well as a large trade and major stopping point for the Caravan Trade Route. The kings of Lihyan were central to political and religious affairs, having ceremonies and seasonal festivals dated to their reign. It began as the growing site of Dedan, and grew to be a centralized power, ruling from cities cut into the rocks, and became belligerent to their prospering Nabataean neighbors in the north."
###Qedar
 Qedar_heritage:0 "Qedaran Heritage"
 Qedar_heritage_desc:0 "Known as the most organized of the North Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were at the height of their expanse and influence during the 6th century BCE, but have since declined as a result of many factors including the growth and centralization of coastal states like Lihyan and the Nabataeans. They were mainly pastoralists who became wealthy with the trade of animal products along the Caravan Trade routes and in between the desert oases. There is evidence of cross-cultural motivations between these Arabian groups and the centralized Aramean states, as noted by Aramean names associated with Qedarites having lived near the border of the north or having been part of the integrated or assimilated tribes which moved about the peripheries of sedentary kingdoms."
###Thamuda
 Thamuda_heritage:0 "Heritage of the First Arabian Kingdom"
 Thamuda_heritage_desc:0 "Attested as early as the late 8th century BCE by contemporary texts, Thamuda, even though it was more of a tribal confederation, was the first kingdom in Arabia. Sargon II claimed to have conquered these people as well as others, exporting them to Samaria, but that Sargon claimed a great many things in his lifetime which cannot all be the accomplishments of one person. Ruled by a local leader instead of an anointed king, their aristocratic class could not have been terribly stable."
###Gerrha
 Gerrha_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Obscenely Rich"
 Gerrha_heritage_desc:0 "These people were supposedly the richest of the Arabs, continuing the life of the prosperity the previous Dilmun civilization experienced, which extended back to the Bronze Age, facilitating much of the trade through the Persian Gulf from India and Eastern Persia into Mesopotamia and, likely, beyond. These men and women were so rich, in fact, that the city of Gerrha was described as having “fancy tools made out of gold and silver, such as the family gold” and “doors, walls, roofs filled with colors, gold, silver, and holy stones.” It is clear that these people lacked little and wanted for nothing, living such prosperous lives. Whomever should lay claim to their land and their lifestyle would find themselves equally rich and carefree."
###Maka
 Maka_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Magan Lords"
 Maka_heritage_desc:0 "The Lords of Magan (Akkadian Makkan) have been recorded since the time of the Sumerians, as early as 2,600 BCE. These famed lords and their domains and their well-built ships brought trade to the region, facilitating goods having come from the Indian and Bactrian area as they traveled into Mesopotamia. The land of Magan also supplied its people and their trade with a great deal of Myrrh and Frankincense, desirable luxuries since time immemorial. These people likely came under the rule of, or at least cooperated with, the Persian empire either during the Cyrus the Great`s reign or during that of Darius I. They remained important trading partners and controlled the flow of goods into the Persian gulf at the point where Arabia and Persia meet."

When Alexander conquered Arachosia alongside the rest of the former eastern Persian satrapies, he placed his general, Sibyrtius in charge of the area. When the Diadochi wars broke out, the general kept his post, and long after Antigonus won the famous Argyraspides, the “Silver Shields,” from Eumenes, he sent many of them to Sibyrtius with orders to get them all killed by means of dangerous missions - they were to uncontrollable to be kept alive."

 satrapy_parthia_heritage:0 "Parthian Heritage"
 satrapy_parthia_heritage_desc:0 "As a region, the history of Parthia traces all the way back to the 7th century BCE and its conquest by the Median Empire and other parts of the Middle East. During the next few centuries, the vassal area would change hands, from the Medians to the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BCE, and from them to the Alexandrian Macedonian Empire and, soon after, the Seleucid Empire in the 4th century BCE. The size of Parthia also fluctuated as larger empires who controlled it changed the administrative methods of the landscape. By the time of Seleucid rule, Parthia was appended to the Hyrcania administrative unit. While under Alexander and the Seleukids, Parthian rule changed hands between several Macedonian war-time generals and noblemen, and reamined oftentimes unstable as a background satrapy, far away from the frontlines and capital of its respective overlords. This allowed for its rebellious nature to grow, and perhaps the Macedonian governors were simply keeping the seat warm for someone better…"
 ###Parnia
 parnia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Children of Artaxerxes II"
 parnia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the three tribes of the Dahae, the Parni were those famous people who would invade the newly freed Seleukid satrapy of Parthia and found the famous and dangerous Arsacid dynasty. Believing their royal line to have come down from Achaemenid King Artaxerxes II, they carry a great claim of legitimacy to rule the Iranian plateau, reportedly speaking a language between Scythian and Median, but were more likely to have simply been a Scythian tribe which migrated from south into to the Orchus river along with many other tribes which took up residence along the greater Oxus river as part of the great wave of nomadic migrations."
 ###Tigraxaudia
 tigraxaudia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pointed-Hat Sakas"
 tigraxaudia_heritage_desc:0 "Either called by foreigners or designated by themselves, the Tigrakhauda tribes were known for the tigra-khauda, or “pointy-hat.” Tall hats were signifiers of nobility among many of the steppe tribes from East to West, but the Persians left us this name to distinguish them from other nomads in the Iranian East. These people, as an individual tribe or as the leader of a tribal confederation, dominated the area and caused chaos for Persian and Western rulers as early as the 8th century BCE. As they conquered, they bade their subjects to construct large mud-brick banquet halls or sleeping quarters on par with Scandinavian longhouses."
 ###Zanthia
 zanthia_heritage:0 "Zanthian Heritage"
 zanthia_heritage_desc:0 "The Zanthi (or Xanthii) were one of the many Dahae tribes living on the Caspian Steppe from after the early waves of Scythian tribal migrations which were supposedly started by the Massagetae. Roaming the desert-steppe lands east of the seaside Parni and west of the settled Khwarazmi people based around the Oxus river and the southern Aral Sea, the Zanthi were a minor tribal group, their clans stuck between the Parni who were growing in power and prominence, about to establish the Arsacid dynasty, and the city-folk, famed for their far-reaching fortifications."
 ###Pissuria
 pissuria_heritage:0 "Pissurian Heritage"
 pissuria_heritage_desc:0 "The Pissuri were one of the many Dahae tribes living on the Caspian Steppe from after the early waves of Scythian tribal migrations which were supposedly started by the Massagetae. Roaming the lands north of the satrapy of Parthia, the Pissuri clans live at the mountain edge before the vast desert-steppe begins, stretching all the way to the Aral Sea and beyond. They were one of the minor tribes of the Dahae during the time when the Parni would rise to conquer Parthia and establish the Arsacid dynasty."
 ###Kharesmia
 kharesmia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Afrasiab"
 kharesmia_heritage_desc:0 "Known as Kharazm and Chorasmia to the Greeks, this place has been a hub of civilization since the Bronze Age, when the Oxus Civilization (so named because it was centered around the Oxus river) thrived, importing goods all the way from Mycenaean Greece. This Bronze Age civilization has also been called the Bactria-Margiana civilization/complex. The land is fraught with many ancient myths and possibilities, with later Islamic scholars proclaiming that mythical figures such as the king Afrasiab founded the ancient Khwarazmian kingdom. This man, Afrasiab, has been etymologically identified with the Persian Parsondes, king of the Cadusii and famed for his part in the issue of legendary Median and Persian conflict. A cultural mix of late Sakan and Bactrian peoples, Khwarazm was a bastion of civilization hidden among the deserts, famed for its 50 fortresses guarding the oasis."
 ###Massagetae
 massagetae_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Great Sakas"
 massagetae_heritage_desc:0 "These people, the Massagetae, are those tribesmen cited as the one who pushed the ancient Scythians west, into the land of the Cimmerians, pushing those nomads to new lands where they ravaged the Iranian Plateau and other places unfamiliar to horse-lord raids. It is claimed by several reports that the queen of these clans, Tomyris, defeated the prodigy king, Cyrus the Great, in open combat when he invaded her lands with the armies of the largest empire in the known world. The head of Cyrus was her prize. Rightly so, the civilized world fears this tribe greatly."
 ###Amyrgia
 amyrgia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Haoma-Drinkers"
 amyrgia_heritage_desc:0 "These saka, when they were led by the King Amorges, for whom they are so named - Amyrgians, were conquered by Cyrus the Great as part of his expanding Persian Empire. However, it was the queen Sparethra who gave their sovereignty to Cyrus when she raised an army to get her captured husband back from the Persian king, only to find how well he had been treated by those she and her people had considered barbarous invaders. This queen and her forces would soon serve Cyrus as a part of his growing army, helping him defeat Croesus of Lydia."
 ###Kucha
 kucha_heritage:0 "Kuchan Heritage"
 kucha_heritage_desc:0 "The most fertile, civilized and populated of all the Tarim-Basin oases, Kucha was a bastion of civilization along the harsh desert and snowy mountains. It acted as a major trading station in the eastern to western connection which would become the famed Silk Road, but the land also maintained an air of holiness, being home to many peaceful monks among the mountains. In war, they were noted for the strength of their chainmail armor which was fashioned in kind to the Iranian west. For travelers and merchants, it was the land of many fortressed cities living at the edge of the world."
 ###Shule
 shule_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Jade Gate"
 shule_heritage_desc:0 "At the foot of the Pamir mountains which connect to the Tian-Shan and the Himalayan ranges, Saka-speaking Shule sits at the beginning of the northern elements of what would become the Silk Road, at the western entrance of the Tarim Basin. Its capital, Kashgar, named for the same river which weaves its way through the mountains, guards the Yumen Pass, better known as the Jade Gate. Almost all trade in the area must come through this kingdom if the merchants wish for their goods to reach larger markets beyond the oases kingdoms."
 ###Phrynia
 phrynia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Toads"
 phrynia_heritage_desc:0 "Set within the heartland of the Pamir mountains, the mysterious Phryni live in a place of isolation from outsiders. These Scythian/Sakan clans live in what may be the modern day Hunza Valley, which follows the Hunza river and was a bed of mixture between the Bon and Buddhist faiths in the region as they transferred across the mountains on the backs of caravans. These people, while inhabiting a confined mountain-space, would have controlled trade routes in the region from with territorial influence around all the Pamir mountains."
 ###Pishan
 pishan_heritage:0 "Pishan Heritage"
 pishan_heritage_desc:0 "Pishan was a caravan hub and trading stop which sat at the beginning of many paths into the Pamir mountains and other mountain valleys. Bearing 500 fighting men, the settlement of Pishan itself and its kingdom were miniscule, but served as junctions of trade between China and Arachosia or the Indian subcontinent. A great few people earned a great sum of money with this trade."
 ###Khotan
 khotan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Land of Cows"
 khotan_heritage_desc:0 "Known in Sanskrit as “The Land of Cows,” Khotan was a land of prosperity and cultural beauty. Noted as one of the earliest Buddhist states in history and a Saka-speaking nation, its strange mixture of identities was the result of its being  great connection point between the major trade lines connecting China, the Indian subcontinent, and Central Asia where other Tarim-Basin oasis cities only connected one or two areas."
 ###Loulan
 loulan_heritage:0 "Loulan Heritage"
 loulan_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the edge of the Lop Desert, which joins the Tarim Basin, it sat at the beginning of the Northern Route which would become one of the main threads of the Silk Road. The quick-growing and cosmopolitan cities of the Loulan Kingdom allowed for it to control much of the trade in the area and to expand, encompassing rival cities in order to negate neighborly competition. It sits poised to control much of the Tarim Basin with its growing power."

 ## Northern Heritages
 ### Gelonia
 gelonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Three Keeps"
 gelonia_heritage_desc:0 "It is said the Gelonians, or the Gelonii, are sons of Greek Gelonus, who himself was the son of Herakles and brother of Scythes. It is also said that the city of Gelon, which is all wooden and sometimes referred to also as Helon, is home to Greek people having forgone their lives in the coastal emporia. In Gelon, the citizens speak a language between Greek and Scythian, as they are influenced by the surrounding clans of the Budini, who live in the forests to the north and also in the territory around the city itself. Within its great walls and the three fortified keeps, there many workshops and stalls can be found where craftsmen and goldsmiths play at their work, manufacturing great wonders and art for the nobility and for trade. At the edge of the great step, where the northern treeline and the far reaches of the cold desert to the north begin, the city stands as the last civilized place in all the world."
 ### Budinia
 budinia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Camouflaged Reindeer"
 budinia_heritage_desc:0 "The Budini are a hidden tribe, numerous in number, but kept in secrecy by the many forests which they inhabit. Their territory lies north of and around the great wooden city and fort of Gelon, which holds Greeks and Scythians. Some say the Budini themselves speak a Scythian tongue, yet others say that those tree-dwellers with blue eyes speak a tongue belonging to forest-folk. They are clothed in many furs, and wandering travelers have claimed to have seen reindeer the size of an ox moving between the bushes in the treeline, who are hard to see because their fur changes its hue across the seasons."
 ### Borysthenia
 borysthenia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Borysthenia"
 borysthenia_heritage_desc:0 "Those people living along the river Borysthenes live a good life off of the rich river-fed lands and the wealth of trees which dot the northern landscape. Ages ago, in the seventh century, the first Scythian peoples came into these lands, invading and besieging the biggest local forts. Once those living along the river had been conquered, they continued in daily activities under the watch of Scythian nobility, maintaining many traditional customs and values and seeing the administrative guidance of the steppe lords."
 ### Melanchlaenia
 melanchlaenia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Black-Cloaks"
 melanchlaenia_heritage_desc:0 "The Melanchlaeni, who are almost themselves a myth, live to the far north, beyond the Budini and east of the cannibalistic Androphagi. Their name, which is known only to the Greeks, surely refers to the dark hides they wear over their bodies, for thick hides provide a great deal of insulation in the harsh cold and the gales of the winds which funnel through the clusters of trees. Should the clans of these tribes travel south, one may imagine they will move in the night like bodyless shadows, striking in the dark and drawing terror over all the settled world."
 ### Neuria
 neuria_heritage:0 "Heritage of Lycanthropy"
 neuria_heritage_desc:0 "The Neuri are only separated from the many Scythian groups by the river Tyras, themselves living along the Hypanis. Yet, while they may have looked across the Scythians on the other side of the river, they practiced many Scythian customs, mixing them with their own. Perhaps this came about when they were driven out of their homeland by a great army of snakes, and left to live among the Budini for a while, whom Greeks say speak a Scythian language. Yet, they returned, and conquered the serpentine lands, possibly using their powers of lycanthropy, for the the members of the Neuri, they say, on occasion take the form of a wolf for a few days in the year."
 ### Agathyrsia
 agathyrsia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Estranged Cousin"
 agathyrsia_heritage_desc:0 "The Agathyrsi are a mut-people, exhibiting characteristics one may call Scythian, Thracian, Celtic, and Venetic at different times. They live by the Carpathians at the edge of the western steppe, but these people were still descendants of the divine son Agathyrsus, and trace their lineage with the Scythians themselves. They each take many wives, and are a luxurious and greedy bunch, sleeping with the wives of their close friends on many occasions. They were once much closer to the Scythians of the Pontic Steppe but, after they killed the Scythian King Ariapeithes they have estranged themselves, and live in isolation."
 ### Carpia
 carpia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Carpi"
 carpia_heritage_desc:0 "The Carpi are a people tied to the great mountains, which they may either take their name from or give a name to, the Carpathians. The Carpi themselves are another mutt-tribe, hard to distinguish in their shared Dacian, Getic, and Sarmato-Scythian elements. What is known is that they are belligerent people, and have a great history of invasion and sustained war, which their neighbors fear them for. The only way to avoid their attacks is to join them."
 ### Aroteria
 aroteria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Steppe Farmers"
 aroteria_heritage_desc:0 "The Aroteres are a Scythian people, or at least a Scythian-ruled people. They grow many cereals on the fertile lands next to crisscrossing rivers and river tributaries, but they are not just consumers. They sell this bounty to the Pontus Euxinos below and to the wide sea beyond, giving the area the title of “Bread Basket,” along others such as the Nile Delta. It is likely that these people came under Scythian rule and themselves became in blood and practice Scythians by the end of the 7th century BCE migrations, when the natives were hard-pressed to capitulate to the immigrating steppe lords and their wide herds and hordes."
 ### Alizonia
 alizonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Alizones"
 alizonia_heritage_desc:0 "The Alizones can be found between the coastal Callipidae, who are themselves part Greek and part Scythian in nature, and the up-river Aroteres, who are great farmers and enjoy the sowing and the reaping of their cereal grains. They are ruled by Scythians, and have themselves adopted Scythian customs through blood and assimilation, but exist as a rather calm and servile nation, happily living off the endless plains."

 ## Indian Heritages
 ###Gandhara
 gandhara_heritage:0 "Gandharan Heritage"
 gandhara_heritage_desc:0 "One of the 16 ancient mahajanapadas, or Indian kingdoms, Gandhara was featured as one of the western kingdoms in the Mahabharata and Ramayana Epic Poems. Famed in these texts for its founder, Prince Gandhara, son of Druhyu, and Prince Shakuni, himself a cause of the legendary Kurukshetra War, Gandhara was an important border point between India and the western world. India was rudely introduced to these powers militarily when King Darius I marched through the Khyber Pass and conquered the kingdom. From that point on, Gandhara would serve as the subject of larger groups, transferring from the state of a Persian satrapy to a Macedonian Greek satrapy following the conquest of Alexander, and then that of the Seleukids, before it would finally be transferred back to Indian control as a part of the vast Mauryan Empire. However, under foreign rule, the cities of Peshawar and Taxila thrived with the introduction of more efficient government and became centers of wealth and technological and faith reform."
 ###Khamboja
 khamboja_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ashvakas"
 khamboja_heritage_desc:0 "One of the 16 mahajanapadas, or Great Kingdoms in India, the Khambojas were originally a set of tribes which coalesced over time into a stable polity. Their history is set back within the time of the Mahbharata, when the Epic protagonist Karna, son of the god Surya, defeated the Khambojan King Sudakshina. These peoples were set apart from their neighbors for their warrior caste system and adherence to non-Brahmanical sacred rituals. They were fearsome on the battlefield, fighting their own enemies and the enemies of their allies or employers with their famed Ashvakas, which may have been known to the Greeks as Aspasioi."
