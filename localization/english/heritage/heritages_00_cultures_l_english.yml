 #Some more random heritages
 carnian_heritage:0 "Carnian Heritage"
 carnian_heritage_desc:0 "The Carni were a people living on the edge of the Eastern Alps. Once trapped within the relatively sparse Alpine homeland, they frequently wintered in the more fertile plains of the Eastern Po Vally, eventually moving into the most eastwards lowlands of these plains where they founded the settlement of Aquileia at the beginning of the second century B.C.E. Their success was not to last however, as near the end of the century they would be defeated by the Romans in battle, with their Aquileia becoming a Roman colony and their people latinized. - To this day their identity appears somewhat dubious, likely owing to cultural mixture with their Venetic and Illyrian neighbours."
