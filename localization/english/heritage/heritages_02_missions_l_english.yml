 #HERITAGES From Greek Pontus Missions
 istrian_league_heritage:0 "Istrian League Heritage"
 istrian_league_heritage_desc:0 "Herodotus and many others once thought the Ister ran its course through all of Europe, connecting the Euxinus to the Western Great Sea. While this is unfortunately far from the truth, the importance of the Ister cannot be understated as a railroad of trade into the inner tribal lands. And yet, not every tribe is particularly friendly - they are barbarians, and the Hellenic cities on the western Euxinus must prepare for anything."
 bosporan_league_heritage:0 "Bosporan League Heritage"
 bosporan_league_heritage_desc:0 "The nations on the northern Euxinus coast have banded together to create a unified final front between the Hellenic world and the barbarian unknown beyond. Each city thrives as a result of the vast array of cereal fields at their disposal, but their job is a thankless one. They are seen by most Hellenes as being too barbarian themselves, having mixed with the tribal clans for too long."
 pontic_league_heritage:0 "Pontic League Heritage"
 pontic_league_heritage_desc:0 "The Pontic colonies have lived rocky lives far away from their mother cities. Many of them have bordered the greatest and most diverse of empires, allowing citizens from all walks of life into their burgeoning agoras - this has made them a strong and tolerable bunch, as has their need to maintain a strong presence in the Bosporus in order to stabilize trade routes. Even though this makes them a cosmopolitan dream, their first citizens feel lost like foreigners in their own cities."

 hellenized_barbarian_heritage_desc:0 "The thunder crashes as the lighting dashes out of the clouds and spears the ground, but this lot has no fear, for they all see the lord of Olympus, enraged, casting down his thunderbolts onto all of his enemies, of whom they are no longer one. While they can never truly walk into the ancient temples of Hellas and be accepted by the priests without a leering gaze, they are now part of the complex and interconnected web of the Hellenic world."

Built upon a small stretch of land, the place has a small capacity for settlement, but is well-proctected from outside threats and can feed off the rich aluvial soil surrounding the river's banks.

 spartan_patavium_early_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kleomynos"
 spartan_patavium_early_heritage_desc:0 "In the final years of the 4th Century B.C.E., the Spartan prince, Kleomynos, embarked on an expeditionary voyage against the Italians. In our world, it would meet it's end on the river Meduacus in Veneto, with the destruction of his fleet by the Veneti. But in this world, this expedition has resulted in victory.\nKleomynos has forged a new realm over the ancient Venetic city of Patavium, and has brought Spartan aristocrats over to maintain the old traditions of his hellenic homeland. But the brutal nature of his conquest has resulted in the new state of Patauion being mired in infamy, and being seen in contempt by the native population."
 spartan_patavium_late_heritage_1:0 "Patauian Heritage"
 spartan_patavium_late_heritage_1_desc:0 "A relatively new addition to the Hellenic world, the city of Patauion was originaly a rich Venetic city, before being conquered by the Spartan Kleomynos. Though there was once great tension between the native Patavii and their Spartan overlords, the two people have since gradually become one, with the Hellenic upper class adopting many of the Venetic traditions, such as a focus on a cavalry-centered aristocracy, while the lowerclasses have slowly switched to a bastardised form of Greek. While Patauion no longer suffers from the social tension that filled it not to long ago, lower taxation rates have become a necessary aspect of maintaining an amicable social order."
 spartan_patavium_late_heritage_2:0 "Spartan Kingdom Heritage"
 spartan_patavium_late_heritage_2_desc:0 "Forged through the exploits of Kleonymos, the kingdom of Patauion was forged through fire and blood. Through subjegating the Patavi locals as a new Helot class, a process that involved much bloodshed, the Hellenic rulers of Patauion have established a new Spartan kingdom far away from the Peloponnese. One which combines the old martial traditions of the Spartans, with a willingness to recruit local mercenaries to make up for a lack of numbers."

 free_patavium_heritage_desc:0 "The Patavi were once proud nobles, before being enslaved by Spartan overlords.

The Patavi now stand ready against all external threats, ready to make sure that they are never made into slaved again."
 atestine_heritage:0 "Atestine Heritage"
 atestine_heritage_desc:0 "One of the most powerful cities of ancient Venetia, Ateste was a center of old Venetic culture, being famed for their decorated bronze situlas, Ateste became a hotspot of local trade and prestige. However this power did not go uncontested, and Ateste regularly competed with their Patavi neigbours to their east. In addition to producing situlas and ceramic, Ateste was also the site of a great temple to the goddess Reitia, one of the principal deities of the ancient Veneti, to which travelers would come from far and wide for the chance to write votive inscriptions for the goddess. So important was this sanctuary, that artifacts spanning many hundreds of years, and from many foreign lands, have been found at the site."
 heritage_of_altinos:0 "Heritage of Altino"
 heritage_of_altinos_desc:0 "A truely ancient city, Altinium was formed by the Veneti not long after their arrival into northern Italy, being founded by the 10th century B.C.E. Situated on the edge of the Venetian lagoon, the strategic position of the settlement allowed it to take advantage of incoming trade to grow quickly. The city was also the site of a large grove to its patron god, Altino, to whom horses would often be offered as sacrifices and buried."
 opitergian_heritage:0 "Opitergian Heritage"
 opitergian_heritage_desc: "Situated in central Venetia, the settlement of Opterigium was one of several with high strategic importance for the Veneti. With a name that likely stems from the Venetic root for 'market square', Opitergium made good use of both its position in between the Navisego and Monticano rivers, and the fertile surrounding lands that could support a decently sized population, to become a rich commercial urban centre."
 akelonian_heritage:0 "Akelonian Heritage"
 akelonian_heritage_desc:0 "With its name possibly deriving from the indo-european root for pointed (*ak), owing to its defensible hilltop location, Acelum was a significant Venetic settlement. Though not as prominent as the likes of Patavium and Ateste, the presence of sheephearding and its position in between larger Venetic trading centres meant that Acelum was able to develop a sizable local economy."
 heritage_of_the_shining_city_belodunum:0 "Heritage of the Shining Settlement"
 heritage_of_the_shining_city_belodunum_desc:0 "With a name likely being a celtic toponym meaning 'the shining city', Belodunum truly exemplified the influence that Celts had on Venetic communities in the 4th century B.C.E. While having existed in some form since the first half of the second millenium B.C.E., Belodunum really grew starting in the 5th century B.C.E., with a material culture that was highly mixed with that of the Celts that had started to move into northern Italy during this time. In spite of this cultural mix however, the Shining City would ulimately side with Rome during their anti-Gallic campaigns into Cisalpine Gaul."
 heritage_of_tarvision:0 "Heritage of the Bull Settlement"
 heritage_of_tarvision_desc:0 "A Venetic settlement of a not unsignificant size, Tarvisium was built on the three hills aside the river Sile. With many peoples having came and went, the exact origins of the settlement are shrouded in mystery. Its name too, is of uncertain origin. Perhaps it comes from the Celtic word for bull 'Tarvos', after which an invading Gallic tribe may have been named, or maybe the city was named after the three hills upon which it was founded."
 heritage_of_the_patavi:0 "Patavian Heritage"
 heritage_of_the_patavi_desc:0 "Possibly the most famous of the old Venetic cities, Patavium stands as one of the oldest cites in Western Europe. According to legend, it was founded by the trojan prince Antenor, as he lead the Enetoi tribe from Paphlagonia in the aftermath of the Trojan war, in 1185 B.C.E. More realisticaly, the city saw its origins as one of the first settlements founded by the Veneti as they entered Venetia in the 11-10th centuries B.C.E. Whatever the case, the Patavi stand as hereditors of centuries of Venetic urbanization, and are ready to defend their proud city, whatever the cost, even if it does put them into conflict with their neighbours."
 veiketinian_heritage:0 "Veicetinian Heritage"
 veiketinian_heritage_desc:0 "The city known as Vicetia to the Romans was one of the larger urban centres of the Veneti. Having been inhabited for centuries, Vicentia was built many times upon itself. With a toponym coming from the proto-european root for 'weik' (a term loosly akin to a village), it can be said that the Vicentini were highly dedicated to the preservation and maintenance of their city. Like the Atestines, the Vicentini also greatly reveared the goddess Reitia, though this didn't keep them from entering border disagreements with their neighbour every once in a while."
