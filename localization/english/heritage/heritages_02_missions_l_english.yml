 corinthian_heritage_desc:0 "Corinth was one of the largest city-states of Greece until recent years, playing an important role as it was at a highly defensive position in-between the rich states of Attica and the Peleponnese. After the conquests of Macedon, it was left as nothing more than a fortified position for the Macedonian troops in the south, bereft of its own independence."

 #HERITAGES From Greek Pontus Missions
 istrian_league_heritage:0 "Istrian League Heritage"
 istrian_league_heritage_desc:0 "Herodotus and many others once thought the Ister ran its course through all of Europe, connecting the Euxinus to the Western Great Sea. While this is unfortunately far from the truth, the importance of the Ister cannot be understated as a railroad of trade into the inner tribal lands. And yet, not every tribe is particularly friendly - they are barbarians, and the Hellenic cities on the western Euxinus must prepare for anything."
 bosporan_league_heritage:0 "Bosporan League Heritage"
 bosporan_league_heritage_desc:0 "The nations on the northern Euxinus coast have banded together to create a unified final front between the Hellenic world and the barbarian unknown beyond. Each city thrives as a result of the vast array of cereal fields at their disposal, but their job is a thankless one. They are seen by most Hellenes as being too barbarian themselves, having mixed with the tribal clans for too long."
 pontic_league_heritage:0 "Pontic League Heritage"
 pontic_league_heritage_desc:0 "The Pontic colonies have lived rocky lives far away from their mother cities. Many of them have bordered the greatest and most diverse of empires, allowing citizens from all walks of life into their burgeoning agoras - this has made them a strong and tolerable bunch, as has their need to maintain a strong presence in the Bosporus in order to stabilize trade routes. Even though this makes them a cosmopolitan dream, their first citizens feel lost like foreigners in their own cities."

 #Scythia Greek Mission Heritages
 hellenized_barbarian_heritage:0 "Hellenized Barbarian Heritage"
 hellenized_barbarian_heritage_desc:0 "The thunder crashes as the lighting dashes out of the clouds and spears the ground, but this lot has no fear, for they all see the lord of Olympus, enraged, casting down his thunderbolts onto all of his enemies, of whom they are no longer one. While they can never truly walk into the ancient temples of Hellas and be accepted by the priests without a leering gaze, they are now part of the complex and interconnected web of the Hellenic world."
 #Judea Flavor Heritage
 hebrew_egypt_heritage:0 "Mitzri Heritage"
 hebrew_egypt_heritage_desc:0 "Mitzrayim is the Hebrew name for Egypt. Since the conquest of Egypt, a new class of Hebrews has emerged. The masters of Egypt, the Mitzrayim rule a fertile land of great wealth. However, it is a divided land. The Hebrews have not been kind to their former oppressors. With the expansion of slavery and the harsh exploitation of the population, the yearning for freedom grows - a yearning that could be dangerous if it is not kept in check."
