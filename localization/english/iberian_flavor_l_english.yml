 # Starting Events
 iberian_starting_country_events.tut.t:0 "Heirs of Tartessos"
 iberian_starting_country_events.tut.desc:0 "The land of the Turdetanians received many names in the past; the most widely used was #E Tartessos#!. This state lies along the diffuse line of myth, and legends talk about the riches and prosperity of the kingdom ruled by the Silver Man himself, Arganthonios. Although #E Turdetania#! was never united under one kingdom.\n\nPhoenicians and Greeks have tried to colonize the area since the dawn of time to have access to the rich mines and fertile lands of #E Turdetania#!. Legends talk about the fall of the #E Tartessos#! culture two centuries ago at the end of the battle of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName] between a coalition of [GetCountry('ETR').GetAdjective]s and [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s and the Phocaean Greeks of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], but the truth is more complex than that, being a mixture of economic deceleration, climate changes and a social crisis among others.\n\nThe land of #E Turdetania#! is divided on three parts. The western region is mainly dedicated to the rich metal extractions of the [GetProvince('(int32)1414').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1356').GetName] mines and the other two are #E Lower Baetica#! and #E Middle Baetica#!. While the #E Lower Baetica#! region bases its wealth from the lucrative flow of the trade routes from the western region and the [GetProvince('(int32)7772').GetName] river the #E Middle Baetica#! benefits of extensive and rich farmlands that supply the entire region and beyond, exporting the surplus to the Punic colonies of Iberia and North Africa.\n\nPhoenician influence had been constant in the region, and lead to a situation in which Canaanite gods were worshiped equally as often as the local gods, especially the goddess 'Ashtart and the god Melqart. The upper classes took a step forward and embraced Punic customs as their own. This situation created a rich melting pot that created a unique culture.\n\nInstability galvanizes the region in a time when the [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s are at the gates of #E Turdetania#! looking for her wealth. Only time will tell if the Turdetanians will survive."

 iberian_starting_country_events.crm.desc:0 "Inland Turdetania, near the [GetProvince('(int32)7772').GetName] River, is where the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1374').GetName] is located. This city once lived a quiet life, living off the trade and specializing in metallurgy, but the political instability that devastated #E Turdetania#!after the crisis of the #E Tartessos#! culture changed the [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective]s.\n\nThe mastery of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] in the use of metals, their central position on the [GetProvince('(int32)7772').GetName] River, the Punic settlement of [GetProvince('(int32)1355').GetName] and the rich agricultural lands surrounding the city make [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] a privileged state in the region. But their neighbors have similar advantages and won't be easy to maintain them subjugated in case the legitimacy of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] is in question.\n\nWill [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] be able to use all that advantages to become the hegemon of #E Turdetania#! or will they remain as a secondary settlement as it was before?"

Rivers, [GetProvince('(int32)1339').GetName] benefices from a defendable location as well as being the main trade hud from the commerce of the metals extracted from the rich mines of [GetProvince('(int32)1414').GetName].\n\nAlthough the previously wealthy mines of [GetProvince('(int32)1414').GetName] are starting to get depleted for overexploitation and the consequent change of the main mining extraction to the rich mines of [GetCountry('ORT').GetName], [GetCountry('ONU').GetName] is still one of the riches Turdetanian states and benefits from close ties with the Punic population of Iberia. [GetCountry('ONU').GetName] is famous for their #E Garum#! production too thanks to its thriving fishing industry, being one of the largest producers behind the nearby Punic city of Gadir.\n\nDemographically, [GetCountry('ONU').GetName] is a fairly diverse state. Since the first Phoenicians traveled beyond the Pillars of Herakles, the Canaanites had trade and settled in [GetCountry('ONU').GetName], being a significant minority in cities such as [GetProvince('(int32)1339').GetName] or [GetProvince('(int32)1335').GetName]. Two centuries ago, during the crisis of the #E Tartessos#! culture, Celtic tribes migrated from the #E Central Plateau#! to the lands called [GetCountry('BDL').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1337').GetArea.GetName]. Now, as well as Punics, Celtician settlers are migrating to [GetCountry('ONU').GetName] making the region a true melting pot."

Looking to enlarge their influence, [GetCountry('LSC').GetName] was subjugated and now live under [GetCountry('ASA').GetAdjective] rules. Being located on #E Lower Baetis#!, the lands arround [GetProvince('(int32)1342').GetName] are made of the deposits of the river and not as fertile as the lands of the #E Middle Baetis#!, but their strategic location made them one of the greatest trade hubs of #E Turdetania#!, in which market a merchant could find from [GetCountry('ORT').GetAdjective] and [GetCountry('IPT').GetAdjective] metals to [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] and [GetCountry('ASG').GetAdjective] grain and wine.\n\nWill [GetCountry('ASA').GetName] become the hegemon of #E Turdetania#! or will their light be extinguished by another power?"

They called it [GetCountry('GAD').GetName], 'The Stronghold.' As one of the oldest Phoenician Colonies in Western Mediterranean, the city's riches come from its access to the Atlantic Tin routes and the Turdetanian mines.\n\n[GetCountry('GAD').GetName] is well known for another reason; the Garum of [GetProvince('(int32)1344').GetName] enjoys wide recognition as the best seasoning in the Mediterranean world, being consumed from Iberia to Anatolia and beyond.\n\nThe end of the Battle of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName] two centuries ago and the fall of Greek influence on Western Mediterranean were good news at first. [GetCountry('GAD').GetName] reinvented itself from an extractive colony to become the main trading hub beyond the Pillars. [GetCountry('GAD').GetName] leads a League integrated by other Punic colonies that fell into [GetCountry('GAD').GetAdjective] influence, developing and controlling the Atlantic trade from the Cassiterides to Arambys.\n\nBut [GetCountry('GAD').GetAdjective] pre-eminence is disputed by the rise of [GetCountry('CAR').GetName]. The heirs of Dido want [GetCountry('GAD').GetName]'s position, however, the [GetCountry('GAD').GetAdjective]s count with the patronage of the god Melqart itself and his Oracle.

 iberian_starting_country_events.sgs.desc:0 "On the Eastern coast of Iberia lays [GetProvince('(int32)1029').GetName], known as Saguntum by the Romans. Edetanians flocked to the Massalian harbor of Sagointium on the Levantine Coast to sell their wares, moving en masse to a series of hills overlooking the trading post. There they established a city that they called Arse. The Edetanian settlement started to grow, trading with goods coming from the hinterlands of Iberian Peninsula and as well of those of their own manufacture. Good relations with the Greeks of [GetCountry('MAS').GetName], [GetCountry('HMK').GetName], and [GetCountry('EPO').GetName] created a fluent stream of cultural and economic exchanges.\n\nThe composite city of [GetProvince('(int32)1029').GetName] is divided into two cores. First comes the city itself, surrounded by sturdy walls, protecting the main government buildings of the state. Outside lays the port, called 'Sagointium' and where the majority of the Greek merchants live. The port of Sagointium sees ships docking from different places and [GetProvince('(int32)1029').GetName]'s walls protect its people from external threats. [GetCountry('SGS').GetName] has the honor of being the first Iberian city to issue her own coins.\n\nTime will tell if [GetCountry('SGS').GetName] will keep growing or perish under a stronger enemy, just remember to be wary if a chap named Hannibal appears before your gates."
