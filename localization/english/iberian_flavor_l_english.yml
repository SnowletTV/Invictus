 deity_urtzi:0 "$omen_urtzi$"
 omen_urtzi:0 "Urtzi"
 omen_urtzi_desc:0 "Urtzi has an interesting case for existence. Many argue that Urtzi must have been a sky god as many names, places, and words seem to bear the root of Urtzi, as well as some outside sources claim that the Mariite religion was home to such a sky god, however some scholars believe that Urtzi is actually just a word for sky. It is possible that both hypothesis are true, however, we may also never know the truth behind this mystery."

This city once lived a quiet life, living off the trade and specializing in metallurgy, but the political instability that devastated Turdetania after the fall of #E Tartessos#! changed the [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective]s.\n\nThe mastery of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] in the use of metals gave its army an advantage over its neighbors. The [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] army won many wars against [GetProvince('(int32)1371').GetName], the other great Turdetanian city of the region, which will hopefully one day culminate in a conquest. Hopefully, the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1369').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1372').GetName] will suffer the same fate - if the gods see fit to reward us.\n\nThe recent expansion have drawn the attention of other Turdetanians.

This situation created a rich melting pot that created a unique culture.\n\nInstability galvanizes the region in a time when the [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s are at the gates of Turdetania looking for her wealth.
