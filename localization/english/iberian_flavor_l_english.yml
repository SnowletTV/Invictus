Near the natural mouth of the Lacus and beside the channel that ends just in front of [GetProvince('(int32)1344').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)1342').GetName] grew as one of the biggest Turtedanian cities, with a prosperous market full of life.\n\n[GetCountry('ASA').GetAdjective]s aren't only merchants. Looking to enlarge their influence, [GetCountry('LSC').GetName] was sunjugated. But this pre-eminence was contested by another Turdetanian state, [GetCountry('CRM').GetName]. To prevent [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] expansion to the south, [GetCountry('ASA').GetName] has created a League with [GetCountry('GAD').GetName] and [GetCountry('ONU').GetName].\n\n[GetCountry('ASA').GetName] must prepare itself for an inevitable war if it wants to reamain the center of the region."

This city once lived a quiet life, subsiding off trade and specializing in metallurgy, but this life abruptly ended. Political instability devastated the Turdetanians after the fall of Tartessos, and war was constant.\n\nThe mastery of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] in the use of metals gave it an advantage over its neighbours. The [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] army won many wars against [GetProvince('(int32)1371').GetName], the other great Turdetanian city of the region, culminating in the conquest of the rival city. Later, the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1369').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1372').GetName] befell the same fate.\n\nThe conquests have drawn the attention of the other Turdetanians, who see [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] as a threat. [GetCountry('ASA').GetName], their southern neighbour, seeks to become hegemon of the region, too, and has created a League to prevent both [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective] and [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] expansion. This has created a very tense climate that only time will loosen."

Phoenician settlers have arrived from time to time, but the since [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s expanded into Iberia, migration has increased. Centuries ago, Celtic tribes expanded from the plateau to the lands called [GetCountry('BDL').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1337').GetArea.GetName] - lands previously part of Tartessos.\n\nThe mines are still wealthy, but extractions are declining and commerce with it.

 iberian_starting_country_events.tut.desc:0 "The land of the Turdetanians had many names in the past; the most widely used was Tartessos. This state is a mixture of myth and reality, and legends talk about the riches and prosperity of the kingdom ruled by the Silver Man himself, Arganthonios.\n\nPhoenicians and Greeks have tried to colonise the area since the dawn of time to have access to the rich mines of Turdetania. Legends talk about the fall of Tartessos two centuries ago at the end of the battle of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName] between a coalition of [GetCountry('ETR').GetAdjective]s and [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s and the Phocaean Greeks of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], but the truth is more complex than that.\n\nPhoenician influence had been constant in the region, and lead to a situation in which Canaanite gods were worshipped equally as often as the local gods, especially the goddess Astarte and the god Melqart. The upper classes took a step forward and embraced Punic customs as their own. This situation created a rich melting pot that created a unique culture.\n\nInstability galvanises the region in a time when the [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s are at the gates of Turdetania looking for her wealth.

As one of the oldest Phoenician Colonies in Western Mediterranean, the city's riches come from its access to the Atlantic tin routes and the Turdetanian mines.\n\n[GetCountry('GAD').GetName] is well known for another reason: the Garum of [GetProvince('(int32)1344').GetName] enjoys wide recognition as the best seasoning in the Mediterranean world, being consummed from Iberia to Anatolia and beyond.\n\nThe end of the Battle of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], two centuries ago, and the fall of Greek pre-eminence in the Western Mediterranean, were good news at first, yet the rise of [GetCountry('CAR').GetName] changed that. The [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s pressuring of [GetCountry('GAD').GetName] into becoming a vassal has created tensions between the two former Phoenician colonies.\n\nThe city faces relative isolation due to [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective] meddling, but it has the sympathy of some local powers, like [GetCountry('ASA').GetName] and [GetCountry('ONU').GetName].
