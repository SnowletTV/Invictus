 master_dharana:0 "Master Dharana"
 master_dharana_desc:0 "To practice dharana, the perceiver focuses fully on a single object, called the pratyaya. He strives to block out intrusive thoughts and remain centered on the pratyaya. Dharana is the first step of deep concentration meditation, by which the pratyaya is firmly retained in the mind, but the perceiver remains aware of the separation between himself, the perceived object and the act of meditation. In Vedic belief, dharana is the sixth of eight limbs in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras."
 master_dhyana:0 "Master Dhyana"
 master_dhyana_desc:0 "When the perceiver has mastered dharana, he is able to focus his awareness solely on the object of contemplation (pratyaya). At this point, he grasps the trichotomy formed by himself as the perceiver, the perceived object (pratyaya) and the act of perceiving. By learning to minimize his role as the perceiver, he achieves dhyana, a state of consciousness in which he merges with the perceived object in a process involving breathing control and acute mental focus. Dhyana is distinct from dharana because the perceiver becomes actively engaged with the object of focus. In dhyana, the perceiver is unaware of the act of meditation and is only conscious that his mind and the pratyaya exist. Dhyana means slightly different things in the Jain, Buddhist and Vedic traditions. It likely began in the Sramanic culture of ancient India (6th century BC) and developed in parallel in all three traditions, which mutually influenced each other. In Vedic belief, dhyana is the seventh of eight limbs in Patajali's Yoga Sutras."
 master_samadhi:0 "Master Samadhi"
 master_samadhi_desc:0 "When the perceiver can sustain focus on the pratyaya for an extended period of time and collapse his self-consciousness, the practice of dhyana gives way to samadhi (absorption) and the perceiver melds with the pratyaya. In the Yoga Sutras, the sage Patanjali compares this to placing a clear gem on a colored surface, whereby the gem appears to turn the same color. In samadhi, the consciousness of the perceiver fuses with the object of thought, the pratyaya. The pratyaya is like the colored surface and the perceiver's consciousness is like the transparent gem. Often translated as 'concentration' or 'unification of mind', samadhi is a dissolution of the ego and the last of the eight elements of Buddhism's Noble Eightfold Path. In Vedic belief, it is the eighth limb of the Yoga Sutras, following the sixth limb (dharana) and the seventh limb (dhyana)."

 bhadrabahu.1.t:0 "A Miraculous Occurrence"
 bhadrabahu.1.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have heard reports that a famed Jain monk, a man named Bhadrabahu, has crossed the border from the lands of the Mauryans and has come into our own realm. It seems that the political instability of our neighbors has made our own country an attractive option for refugees, but we were not expecting one such as Bhadrabahu - his presence is already being felt among our people, who gather daily to listen to sermons and join meditations."
 bhadrabahu.1.a:0 "The people see the truth with their own eyes"
 
 bhadrabahu.2.t:0 "The Jain Council Gathers"
 bhadrabahu.2.desc:0 "Apologies for disturbing you this late, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but we wanted to mention a minor thing in passing before we forgot about it. There is news of a great Jain Council convening in the far north, with all of the luminaries of that religion gathering. Among them is the monk Bhadrabahu that has been staying with our people - it appears that he is preparing to leave our country."
 bhadrabahu.2.a:0 "Well, good for them I suppose. I wonder what this all means"
 
 bhadrabahu.3.t:0 "News from the Jain Council"
 bhadrabahu.3.desc:0 "Because we have been following the travels of the Jain monk Bhadrabahu, we thought it worth mentioning that, after a brief period staying in our country, he has returned north to Maurya to join the Jain Council that is meeting. There are already reports of tension between the various sects gathering together, which underlies the reason that this Council has been called in the first place. All are hopeful that the end results will be positive, but it will be very difficult to reconcile some diametrically opposed viewpoints."
 bhadrabahu.3.desc2:0 "Word from the north has trickled down to us, carried by traders who are usually uninterested in this sort of thing - the Jain Council has finally been assembled and is being led by, among others, one Bhadrabahu, whom you have already heard of. There are already reports of tension between the various sects gathering together, which underlies the reason that this Council has been called in the first place. All are hopeful that the end results will be positive, but it will be very difficult to reconcile some diametrically opposed viewpoints."
 first_jain_council_mod:0 "There is a Jain Council meeting in this province, with all of its theologians and famed ascetics gathering together to discuss matters of religious policy."
 bhadrabahu.3.a:0 "Hopefully everything goes well - we look forward to hearing about it"
 
 bhadrabahu.4.t:0 "The Jain Split"
 bhadrabahu.4.desc:0 "Although a years-long famine was devastating the local area, providing a grim backdrop to the meeting, the Jain Council has finally concluded with an unhappy outcome for those interested in keeping any sort of peace. Although progress was made in compiling our sacred texts, writing them down so that the people will be able to remember their teachings throughout this lifetime and those to come, there has been a breakdown in the order of things.\n\nIt seems that one Sthulabhadra, a former pupil of Bhadrabahu, has made a pronouncement against his teacher that has divided everyone into two camps; arguing that nudity is sacred and the preferable way of existing, Sthulabhadra and his followers have abandoned wearing clothing - they call themselves the Svetembara, allowing only men to join their numbers. Bhadrabahu disagrees mightily, proclaiming this to be a heresy, and those who have sided with the venerable old master are calling themselves Digambara.\n\nThere is public pressure for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to publicly chose a side - we will not be able to avoid this issue for much longer."
 bhadrabahu.4.ttt:0 "Bhadrabahu, disgusted by this outcome, will leave forever."
 bhadrabahu.4.a:0 "We support the Digambara movement over the others"
 bhadrabahu.4.tt:0 "Chandragupta, convinced of the truth of the teachings, absconds and heads south with the monk Bhadrabahu."
 bhadrabahu.4.b:0 "Our support goes to the Svetembara, for we see their teachings as correct"
 
 bhadrabahu.5.t:0 "The Death of Bhadrabahu"
 bhadrabahu.5.desc:0 "Bhadrabahu, the Jain monk and leader of the Digambara Sect whose exploits are semi-legendary at this point, has finally passed from this mortal realm into a state of eternal bliss. His followers have proclaimed him to be the Fifth Shrutakevalin, one who had a complete knowledge of the entirety of our teachings, and are spreading Bhadrabahu's teachings far and wide. We believe that the impact of the monk's life will be far greater in death than it was in life."
 bhadrabahu.5.a:0 "To be alive and to have witnessed such things...we are truly fortunate"
 
 jain_flavor.1.t:0 "Famine in Magadha"
 jain_flavor.1.desc:0 "We have received dark word from abroad of famine and we pray to the gods of mercy that such withering miseries do not come to our lands. It seems that the gods have abandoned the province of Magadha, which is truly remarkable; for all of their material wealth and power, the Mauryrans are reduced to a state of crawling on one's hands and knees, with protruding stomachs and wasted limbs."
 jain_flavor.1.a:0 "Do everything and anything we can to prevent this from happening to us"
 jain_flavor.1.b:0 "We have empty pockets and will soon have empty granaries, it seems"
 
 jain_flavor.2.t:0 "The End of Famine"
 jain_flavor.2.desc:0 "Finally, after a period so long that it makes our hearts wither to consider the dead, it seems that the famine that has plagued Magadha has come to an end. Harvests are better than they have been in years, and food imports are beginning to improve, with grain and oil becoming affordable in the marketplaces again. No longer will their people, driven to a state of madness in their hunger and desperation, have to boil the bark of trees and drink grass broth - the gods return and bring their blessings with them."

 jain_flavor.8.t:0 "Paryushana Festival"
 jain_flavor.8.desc:0 "The time of the Paryushana Festival is upon us, when sins accrued throughout the year between brothers are forgotten and a contrite spirit of forgiveness grips men's hearts during the sacred days of Kshamavani and Samvatsari. The community will come together, remembering our sacred teachings, and will renew our spirits and hearts for the year ahead."
 jain_flavor.8.a:0 "It is time to fast!"
 jain_flavor.8.b:0 "A Grand Festival will be held!"
 jain_flavor.8.c:0 "Now is not the time."
 
 jain_flavor.9.t:0 "Mahavir Janma Kalyanak"
 jain_flavor.9.desc:0 "One of the holiest days in our calendar, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, is here, for today we must remember the birth of the last Tirthankara of this present age. Even now, the statue of Mahavir is being prepared for its ritual procession, where it will be drawn upon a chariot and carried throughout the heart of the city. A spirit of charity and thanksgiving pervades the festival, as men show their gratitude by opening their hearts and pockets to each other."
 jain_flavor.9.a:0 "May the spirit of Mahavir be with us"
 jain_flavor.9.b:0 "..."
 
 jain_flavor.10.t:0 "Akshaya Tritiya"
 jain_flavor.10.desc:0 "The joyous occasion of another religious festival is here, with preparations being made throughout the cities and countryside. The Akshaya Tritiya Festival recalls the doings and deeds of the first Tirthankara Rishabhanatha, who broke his sacred fast by partaking in sugarcane juice with grateful, outstretched hands. Those who are able to make pilgrimage will do so, reenacting the travels of Rishabhanatha and going to places sacred to him, whereas those without the means to do so will honor the Tirthankara by abstaining from food. After the period of fasting has ended, there will be celebrations that everyone looks forward to."
 jain_flavor.10.a:0 "The increase of pilgrims will translate to increased sales for our merchants"

 ajivika_flavor.2.desc:0 "In retribution for the murder and burning of a Buddhist monk, the entire Ajivika sect was to pay. 18,000 Ajivika were slaughtered. They will think twice before their foolish attacks on our great Buddhist faith next time. Buddhist citizens rejoice at this purging of the heretics."
