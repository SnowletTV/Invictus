 interesting_histories_country_events.spa.t:0 "Sparta"
 interesting_histories_country_events.spa.desc:0 "The glory days are long over. Only a few decades ago at the Battle of Megalopolis, a Spartan force of 22,000 men was defeated by a 40,000 strong Macedonian army. Spartan King Agis III, wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy his men time to retreat. Sparta has been left in a weakened position with the Messenians threatening to the west, and Argives to the north-east. We need to restore Sparta to its former glory, put an end to our local rivals, and combat the rise of Macedon to the north."

 interesting_histories_country_events.byz.desc:0 "Byzantion was settled in the early days of Greek expansion by colonists of the city-state of Megara.

After being captured during the Persian invasion of Greece, Byzantion was liberated 34 years later by a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias. It has enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city due to its position on the land route from Europe to Asia and the sea route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean."

 interesting_histories_country_events.syr.t:0 "Syracusae"
 interesting_histories_country_events.syr.desc:0 "The fertile lands of Syracusae were originally settled by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea. Over the centuries the small colony grew to become one of the most powerful Greek cities in the Mediterranean, settling cities of its own throughout the island. The power of Syracusae has made unavoidable the clash against the Carthaginians who now rule over the Punic cities to the west. The last devastating war ended a few years ago with another treaty of peace, but this has not prevented the powerful Carthaginians from interfering in the politics of Syracusae. The constant wars and internal struggles have greatly weakened its powers over the island."

Despite strong pressure from Phoenician [GetCountry('CAR').GetName], who have sent their fleets against us many times, the city has managed to retain its independent Hellenic character, but whether this is a fluke of history remains to be seen.\n\nThroughout the years, both political and commercial agreements have been made with the indigenous Iberian tribes, who view [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] with a mix of suspicion and envy. Yet with the growing power of Carthage, and the local tribes becoming better organized, Emporion's existence is strengthened by defensive agreements with the nearby Greek cities of Massilia and Hemeroskopeion, but there are question as to whether this will be enough to keep the city free."
