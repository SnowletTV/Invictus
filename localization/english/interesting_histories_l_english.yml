 interesting_histories_country_events.spa.t:0 "Sparta"
 interesting_histories_country_events.spa.desc:0 "The glory days are long over. Only a few decades ago at the Battle of Megalopolis, a Spartan force of 22,000 men was defeated by a 40,000 strong Macedonian army. Spartan King Agis III, wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy his men time to retreat. Sparta has been left in a weakened position with the Messenians threatening to the west, and Argives to the north-east. We need to restore Sparta to its former glory, put an end to our local rivals, and combat the rise of Macedon to the north."

After being captured during the Persian invasion of Greece, Byzantion was liberated 34 years later by a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias. It has enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city due to its position on the land route from Europe to Asia and the sea route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean."

 interesting_histories_country_events.syr.t:0 "Syracusae"
 interesting_histories_country_events.syr.desc:0 "The fertile lands of Syracusae were originally settled by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea. Over the centuries the small colony grew to become one of the most powerful Greek cities in the Mediterranean, settling cities of its own throughout the island. The power of Syracusae has made unavoidable the clash against the Carthaginians who now rule over the Punic cities to the west. The last devastating war ended a few years ago with another treaty of peace, but this has not prevented the powerful Carthaginians from interfering in the politics of Syracusae. The constant wars and internal struggles have greatly weakened its powers over the island."

For warfare the Veneti prefer traveling fast on foot, using spears or iron swords with wooden shields for battle. Roaming barbarian hordes present a significant threat when they raid Veneti territory along the northern and eastern borders.
