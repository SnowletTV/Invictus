 ROMINTRO:0 "#T Rome#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nAs our game starts, Rome has begun to establish hegemony over surrounding tribes and cultures, sparring frequently with its neighbors. The second Samnite war finished mere months ago, cementing Rome's position as a local power. The looming threat of the Etruscans and Carthaginians requires caution, yet Rome's economy far exceeds its appearance as a territorially emergent state."
 CARINTRO:0 "#T Carthage#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nCarthage has prospered for many centuries before our game begins, holding a number of coastal cities around the Mediterranean. Several subjects continue to pay them tribute, and naval dominance rests firmly in Carthaginian hands. Such a decentralized state is not without problems however, with care required in maintaining the loyalty of far-flung provinces."
 MACINTRO:0 "#T Macedon#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nMacedon, whilst a highly militarized region, was never the richest part of Alexander's empire. The incumbent Antipatrid dynasty, however, has spent many years improving the general infrastructure of the region, and combating any threats to their perceived right to rule. The other successor empires in the east pose quite a threat, and the possibility of large-scale war is always on the horizon."
 EGYINTRO:0 "#T Ptolemaic Kingdom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nPtolemaios' Lagid dynasty holds a firm grip on the incredibly fertile Nile delta. Having recently suffered a crushing naval defeat at the hands of Demetrios, Antigonos' first son, the Egyptian navy is practically non-existent. Nonetheless, the condensed economy of the Nile delta provides a fantastic income base for military reorganization. Care should be taken however, as the majority of the Egyptian population is of differing culture and religion to that of their Greek overlords."
 SELINTRO:1 "#T Seleukid Kingdom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe Seleukid dynasty, headed by Seleukos Nikator, controls the largest of the successor states at our game's onset. Whilst this sprawling empire can summon up vast hosts of soldiers, the proximity of the Mauryas in the east, and the powerful kingdom of Antigonos in the west, can result in conflict in two entirely different spheres. The ruling class consists primarily of Greek nobles, which can often cause conflict with the various cultural groups within Seleukid territory. To add to this situation, a number of dependencies rely on Seleukid support, some with entirely contrasting agendas..."
 PRYINTRO:1 "#T Antigonid Kingdom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe Antigonid Kingdom is the most central of the successor empires, boasting a sizable army, navy, and economy. Antigonos himself is the oldest of the successors, and is viewed with distinct enmity by his peers and neighbors. With a large number of dependent states, the Antigonids must balance a bitter diplomatic situation, disloyal subjects, and an ailing ruler, in order to succeed."

 EPIINTRO:1 "#T Epirus#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nThe kingdom of Epirus occupies a unique position, protected from the Macedonian kingdom by geography, dominating the Ionian coast, and a stones throw from the rich lands of Magna Graecia. However, if the westward ambitions of Alexandros of Epirus, uncle of Alexander the Great, are to be realized, Molossian disputes over the Epirote succession must be settled, and the power of Macedon, Aetolia, and the Illyrian tribes checked in the fallout of the Diadochi wars."
 SPAINTRO:1 "#T Sparta#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThough the heady glories of Thermopylai and the Peloponnesian war are now half-remembered dreams, the Spartan kingdom looks to the collapse of Alexander's Macedonian empire as an opportunity to reignite the flame of Laconian supremacy by dominating the Peloponnese once more. This may be more difficult than it sounds; Sparta's neighbors and old enemies in Messenia and Arcadia fraternize in a cowardly alliance out of fear for sight of our hoplites on the horizon."
 SYRINTRO:1 "#T Syracuse#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe city of Syracuse now totally dominates the other towns of eastern Sicily, an island which has been ravaged by centuries of war between Punic and the Greek interests, and the rise and fall of brutal tyrant kings. The city of Arethousa must recover her former glory while defending against Carthaginian and nascent Italic threats if the island's Hellenic cities are to survive the coming decades and honor their ancestor's victory over Athen's Sicilian expedition."
 ATHINTRO:1 "#T Athens#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nThe glorious days of Marathon, Pericles, and the Delian League are but a distant memory to the citizens of the once mighty city of Athenai, which along with much of Greece now endures under the Macedonian yoke. Viewed as the most important city of the Hellenes by all but the Dorians, Athens must show leadership if she is to survive the ravages of the Diadochi wars and aspire to her former greatness as the liberator and protector of Greece."
 MASINTRO:1 "#T Massilia#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nMassilia is the most successful of the Greek cities of the western Mediterranean, and the main city of the Phocaean colonists, founding the trading posts of Emporion and Hemeroskopeion in Iberia to profit from the flow of trade between the Greek world and the barbarian tribes of this untamed region. The city's survival will depend on a shrewd mixture of diplomacy and opportunism, ensuring the natives are not able to overrun this Hellenic bastion in Gaul."
 TREINTRO:1 "#T Thrace#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nThe satrapy of Lysimachos is looked down upon as the smallest and most remote of the Diadochi kingdoms. Once vital as the bridge between Macedon and the east, the division of Alexander's empire leaves its barbarian lands and Greek colonies lackluster when compared to the riches of other successor kingdoms. To succeed, steps must be taken to counter Antigonid dominance to the south, while ensuring Macedon is not underestimated as a potential enemy to the west."
