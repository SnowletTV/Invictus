 # New Illyrian Military Traditions
 haemic_philosophy:0 "Illyrian Traditions"
 haemic_philosophy_desc:0 "King Haemus of Thrace was vain and haughty and compared himself and his wife, Queen Rhodope, to Zeus and Hera.

They made extensive use of the mountainous terrain for defence while the Illyrians engaged in piracy in the Adriatic.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Raid City#!'

Tradition Focuses#!\nStrong #Y Light Infantry#!\nGood #Y Archers#!, #Y Light Cavalry#!"
 illyrian_piracy_path_1:0 "Illyrian Pirates"
 illyrian_piracy_path_1_desc:0 "With Italia divided amongst rival states and much of Greece focused on conflicts to the east, the Adriatic is easy pickings for pirates sailing out of the many inlets of the Illyrian coast."
 illyrian_piracy_path_2:0 "Lightning Strikes"
 illyrian_piracy_path_2_desc:0 "When facing militarily superior foes, speed is crucial to preserving our forces and taking advantage of terrain."
 illyrian_path_1:0 "The Liburnian"
 illyrian_path_1_desc:0 "The ship that would eventually form the basis of the Roman navy was originally invented by the Illyrian tribe of the same name. Equipped with only one row of oars, one mast and one sail, it could not directly match the larger ships built by the Greeks, but the Illyrians' superior speed and maneuverability let them dominate the Adriatic nonetheless."
 illyrian_piracy_path_5:0 "Bold Sailors"
 illyrian_piracy_path_5_desc:0 "Harsh retaliation against any challenge to free reign of the Adriatic will make others think twice before interfering."
 illyrian_piracy_path_6:0 "Local Shipbuilding"
 illyrian_piracy_path_6_desc:0 "The Illyrian coast provides a swarth of inlets and harbours for shipbuilding, enabling local tribes to construct modest craft on their own initiative."
 illyrian_path_2:0 "Ship Binding"
 illyrian_path_2_desc:0 "A common Illyrian naval tactic was to tie their galleys together in groups of four and provoke hostile ships to ram them. This gave them the opportunity to board the enemy craft with a massive show of force."
 illyrian_path_3:0 "Drakoforos"
 illyrian_path_3_desc:0 "The drakoforos was a ship with a dragon's head mounted on the prow. By building larger and harder-hitting craft, we will be better able to defend our coasts from those who wish us harm."
 illyrian_path_4:0 "Illyrian Mercenaries"
 illyrian_path_4_desc:0 "The fierce fighting men of Illyria were in high demand as mercenaries. With such a glut of sellswords in the area, we should be able to hire them at a fair price."
 illyrian_path_5:0 "The Young Must Serve"
 illyrian_path_5_desc:0 "Learning the art of warfare is a vital part of every youth's education. If a child can wield a sword and maintain their equipment, then they are ready for war."
 illyrian_path_6:0 "Investing in Our Future"
 illyrian_path_6_desc:0 "Raiding and pillaging may bring us riches, but they are quickly spent. We must pour our new wealth back into our communities to strengthen them and ensure their growth."
 illyrian_path_7:0 "Mountain Homes"
 illyrian_path_7_desc:0 "We have bordered more powerful states for centuries, yet the mountains have always protected us from invasions and allowed our people to thrive."
 illyrian_path_8:0 "Dardanian Hoplites"
 illyrian_path_8_desc:0 "Trained by Spartan mercenaries, the Dardanians created hosts of hoplites that once terrorised the Molossians and Macedonians."
 illyrian_path_9:0 "Poised to Strike"
 illyrian_path_9_desc:0 "By the 2nd century BC, the phalanx fell into disuse as the Illyrians opted for small groups of faster-moving armoured troops. By placing more importance on agility and the element of surprise, they were able to defeat the close ranks of their Greek adversaries."

 # New Daco-Thracian Military Traditions
 thracian_path_1:0 "Falx and Sica"
 thracian_path_1_desc:0 "The falx and sica were curved bladed weapons. The edge of the blade was on the inward side of the curve, allowing warriors to strike at the arms and legs around their opponents' shields.  So effective were these weapons, that in later years the Dacian Wars resulted in changes to the standard armour of the Roman soldier."
 thracian_path_2:0 "Thracian Horsemanship"
 thracian_path_2_desc:0 "The cavalry of the Thracians was of particular renown, with Philipp II of Macedon adapting the wedge formation from them. In particular, the Getae in the north were said to be indistinguishable from the feared Scythians."
 thracian_path_3:0 "Tribal Kingdoms"
 thracian_path_3_desc:0 "The area north of Greece saw the emergence of many tribal kingdoms. When united under a strong king, they were a force to be reckoned with, yet such centralisation efforts often faced opposition from various local powerholders jealously guarding their ancient privileges."
 thracian_path_4:0 "Rugged Defence"
 thracian_path_4_desc:0 "The ability to use all our troops in the mountainous regions near our homes is vital to our survival."
 thracian_path_5:0 "Melting Pot"
 thracian_path_5_desc:0 "Throughout the years, the Dacians and Thracians came into contact with many foreign peoples, including Greek colonists, Gallic invaders and Germanic migrants. The native tribes quickly adapted the expertise brought by these foreigners for their own needs."
 thracian_path_6:0 "Colonies"
 thracian_path_6_desc:0 "As our population grows, let us learn from the Greeks to the south and found colonies across the landscape, rewarding veterans with landed property that they will eagerly fight to defend."
 thracian_path_7:0 "Peltasts"
 thracian_path_7_desc:0 "The tribes north of Macedon often shunned armor, which was restricted to nobles and kings. The Thracians in particular preferred to fight as peltasts, carrying javelins alongside a sword and a wicker shield called a pelte. Their great manoeuvrability allowed them to outrun the heavier Greek infantry, while also performing well in melee, unlike dedicated skirmishers."
 thracian_path_8:0 "Take up Arms"
 thracian_path_8_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 thracian_path_9:0 "Dava"
 thracian_path_9_desc:0 "These stone fortresses, built into the mountains, utilised concentric rings of defense allowing defenders to withdraw inward and continue fighting if the outer defences were breached."
 thracian_path_10:0 "The Plains Fight with Us"
 thracian_path_10_desc:0 "The rolling plains of Dacia prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry and fast-moving infantry."
 thracian_path_11:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 thracian_path_11_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defence in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose."
 thracian_path_12:0 "Tarabostes"
 thracian_path_12_desc:0 "Nobles played a very important role in the highly militarised Dacian society. Only Dacian aristocrats had the right to cover their heads and wore felt Phrygian caps. In battle, they might wear a bronze Phrygian helmet, iron scale armour and an oval wooden shield."
 thracian_path_13:0 "Offence Is the Best Defence"
 thracian_path_13_desc:0 "Many of our warriors do not even fight with shields, preferring instead to focus all their energy on relentlessly attacking the enemy."
