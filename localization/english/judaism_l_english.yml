 destroy_jerusalem_temple_desc:0 "Long ago the forefathers of the Judaeans to our South chose, against God's will, to relocate the tabernacle to their lands. Uzzi hid the tent of the congregation in a cave on the holy Mount Gerizim where it miraculously vanished, stopping their plans. Undeterred, they built a heretical temple to replace it on Mount Zion in Jersualem. Now that we control the city, it is time we tore down this false altar that Mount Gerizim will once again be recognized as the sole location ordained for the worship of God."

 gerizim_sanctuary.2.desc:0 "A sudden drought has hit Shekhem, and with it, the work we have been doing on the Sanctuary on Mount Gerizim. Unless we invest a lot of money into transferring food and help from elsewhere, the building progress will certainly be hindered. [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_advisor').GetName] points out we could focus on those working on the sanctuary, to save some of our resources."

 gerizim_sanctuary.3.desc:0 "A large crash followed by the panic of our workers happens as some of the sanctuary falls out in the middle of construction. It seems some of the materials received are barely usable, and unsafe to keep at best.\n\nOur foremen ask for the funds necessary to buy replacements, while [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_advisor').GetName] point out we have materials in other nearby cities we could use."

 gerizim_sanctuary.4.desc:0 "As work progresses on the Mount Gerizim Sanctuary, we have seen a lot of workers disappearing over time. Some have quit their job, some have died and some have simply disappeared. Without a proper workforce to work on the sanctuary, the progress will lag behind and we might not get the result we want."
 gerizim_sanctuary.4.a:0 "New workers will be found."

 gerizim_sanctuary.6.a:0 "Bigger and better!"
 gerizim_sanctuary.6.a.tt:0 "The progress on the Mount Gerizim Sanctuary goes beyond what we originally planned."

 gerizim_sanctuary.8.desc:0 "Word has reached us that a man is speaking in the marketplaces of our towns and cities. He says he made the menorah we claimed to have been the original menorah of the tabernacle, and that he took part in a conspiracy to hide the truth from the people. Since that time he has been tormented by dreams driving him to repent."
