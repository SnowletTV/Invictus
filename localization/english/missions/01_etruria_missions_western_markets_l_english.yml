And while the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is barely able to withhold [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] contempt, all are in agreement that this dishonorable business will benefit our interests - these are powerful men who are willing to assist our nation.\n\nThe first candidate, a notorious Nuragic murderer named [SCOPE.sCharacter('etruscan_western_markets_nuragic_admiral').GetName], is known far and wide for his brutal strength and violence, earning him the dubious nickname that clings to him like the stench of death - there are half a dozen cities across the Mediterranean that would pay a bounty for the head of this savage.\n\nThe second buccaneer, a Bosporan named [SCOPE.sCharacter('etruscan_western_markets_bosporan_admiral').GetName] or #E 'Knucklebone'#!, is a famous gambler and legendary womanizer, a skilled poet and all-around bastard. Even though more than a hundred men pray for his death, Fortune has never withheld her hand from this high-roller and the dice continue to fall his way.\n\nThe third pirate is a bit of a mystery - a Spartan named [SCOPE.sCharacter('etruscan_western_markets_pelop_admiral').GetName] that favors fighting on the sea instead of the land, abandoning the phalanx for the port. Luckily for us, the reputation of the Lacedaemonians as fearless warriors, unequaled in battle, is well-deserved in the case of [SCOPE.sCharacter('etruscan_western_markets_pelop_admiral').GetFirstName].\n\nThe final sword for hire is one of our countrymen, a lad named [SCOPE.sCharacter('etruscan_western_markets_etrus_admiral').GetName] that is a genius of mischief, choosing to use his considerable talents to pursue a life of crime and debauchery instead of servicing the state. Do not let his youth fool you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] - he is a dangerous man, and not one to be trusted."

It seems that the #E Etruscans#! have become more and more familiar with the waters around the #E Pillars of Hercules#!, and because their trade ships have become familiar with our ports and their merchants acquainted with our cities, there are many settlers and travelers living in [GetProvince('(int32)3061').GetName] that speak Etruscan as their mother tongue.\n\nSo many foreigners have migrated to Tingi that there is now a proper #E Etruscan Quarter#! in the city, but fear not, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]; these people will make fine [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizens one day."
