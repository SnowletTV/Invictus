03_tibet_mission_task_1: "The Western Way"
03_tibet_mission_task_1_DESC: "Traveling through the western mountains is an extremely arduous affair, with the difficult terrain no doubt contributing to this region's reputation as a wasteland.

03_tibet_mission_task_4: "Mountain Maneuvers"

03_tibet_mission_task_6_DESC: "Mastery of mountain terrain does not mean that we should ignore fighting in the hilly terrain of our central lands - there are techniques to be gleaned from every corner of our kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

03_tibet_mission_task_7: "Forced Marching In Mountains"
03_tibet_mission_task_7_DESC: "Although we know that our levies will complain bitterly, we have decided to make them march through the mountains every summer.

03_tibet_mission_task_8: "Himalayan Cities"
03_tibet_mission_task_8_DESC: "Now that our highways are finished, the time has come to turn our attention towards the building of cities. There is much work to be done, but we shall not let the enormity of the task deter us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"

03_tibet_mission_task_9_DESC: "The all-important region of #E Tibet#! deserves to have [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] cities built in its most attractive places - let us set our hands to the work that we must do. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

03_tibet_mission_task_10: "Stone Levies"
03_tibet_mission_task_10_DESC: "Our armies have been forged in battle, able to project our power far beyond the gates of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and into kingdoms and lands that are months of hard traveling away - all should fear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and our soldiers of stone! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

03_tibet_mission_task_12: "Buddhist Scholars"
03_tibet_mission_task_12_DESC: "Even though we are traditionally adherents of the Bon faith, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to invite Buddhist scholars to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] so we can hear their sermons in person.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain#!. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil19!"

03_tibet_mission_task_13: "The Mountain Fortress"
03_tibet_mission_task_13_DESC: "If an enemy army is lucky enough to find the passes into our homelands, their hearts drop to their stomachs whenever they see the imposing fortifications that we have built everywhere - it is no wonder that our country is known as 'the Mountain Fortress'. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"
