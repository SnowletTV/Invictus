 03_tibet_mission_task_1: "The Western Way"
 03_tibet_mission_task_1_DESC: "Traveling through the western mountains is an extremely arduous affair, with the difficult terrain no doubt contributing to this region's reputation as a wasteland.

 03_tibet_mission_task_4: "Mountain Maneuvers"
 03_tibet_mission_task_4_DESC: "Now that we have built roads in our hinterlands, we must tell our soldiers that they must train in the mountains - we cannot allow the rocky precipices of our frontier to become a liability in times of war. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
 
 03_tibet_mission_task_5: "The Grand Tibetan Road"

 03_tibet_mission_task_7: "Forced Marching In Mountains"
 03_tibet_mission_task_7_DESC: "Although we know that our levies will complain bitterly, we have decided to make them march through the mountains every summer. We need to make sure that our men are always in fighting shape and this is one of the best ways to do so. Our forces will emulate the example of our #T Legion#!, who stand head and shoulders above all others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil11!"
 
 03_tibet_mission_task_8: "Himalayan Cities"
 03_tibet_mission_task_8_DESC: "Now that our highways are finished, the time has come to turn our attention towards the building of cities. There is much work to be done, but we shall not let the enormity of the task deter us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"
 
 03_tibet_mission_task_9: "Tibetan Towns"
 03_tibet_mission_task_9_DESC: "The all-important region of #E Tibet#! deserves to have [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] cities built in its most attractive places - let us set our hands to the work that we must do. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"
 
 03_tibet_mission_task_10: "Stone Levies"
 03_tibet_mission_task_10_DESC: "Our armies have been forged in battle, able to project our power far beyond the gates of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and into kingdoms and lands that are months of hard traveling away - all should fear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and our soldiers of stone! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

 03_tibet_mission_task_12: "Buddhist Scholars"
 03_tibet_mission_task_12_DESC: "Even though we are traditionally adherents of the Bon faith, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to invite Buddhist scholars to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] so we can hear their sermons in person.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain#!. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil19!"
 
 03_tibet_mission_task_13: "The Mountain Fortress"
 03_tibet_mission_task_13_DESC: "If an enemy army is lucky enough to find the passes into our homelands, their hearts drop to their stomachs whenever they see the imposing fortifications that we have built everywhere - it is no wonder that our country is known as 'the Mountain Fortress'. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

 03_tibet_mission_task_14_DESC: "It is currently quite difficult to bring the horses from the #E Ferghana Valley#! through the mountains and into our homelands - let us see what we can do to change this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil14!"

[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s design was simple enough; a northern highway deep within the mountains and far away from our borders that would allow rapid internal movement, both for our merchants and for our soldiers.\n\nNow that this dream has been realized, all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is praising our crafty leader and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] ingenious vision - who else could have done such a thing, save for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]?"

The air is so cold up here that one's breath is visible, and there is a lack of firewood - who wants to camp out in this country, where we are likely to freeze to death?\n\nIf this is how our foes must rationalize their unwillingness to die at the foothills of our fortresses, then we will allow them this."
