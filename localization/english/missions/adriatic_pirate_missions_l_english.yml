 01_adriatic_pirate_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "It is a great mystery as to why so many foreign ships, their cargo holds packed to bursting with all manner of trade goods, suddenly disappear when they sail through the bright blue waters of the Mare Adriaticum. Naturally, the Illyrian tribes, who are oftentimes accused of being no better than robbers and brigands, know nothing about the matter when asked.\n\nGiven its reputation as a wild, ungovernable region, Illyria is the perfect place for the marauding pirate fleets to hide..."
 01_adriatic_pirate_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we establish a dread #Y Pirate Kingdom#! in Illyria and use the resources of our country to attack the major trade routes."
