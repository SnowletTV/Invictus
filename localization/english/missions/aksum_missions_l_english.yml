#Mission 1

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia:0 "Aksumite Ascension"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_DESCRIPTION:0 "The kingdom of Aksum, nestled in the mountainous highlands of Ethiopia, is at a crossroads, both literally and figuratively - there are many who travel through our kingdom and wonder at our marvels. Yet there are great opportunities for the bold in these lands; by preparing to conquer our neighbors, we will control the rich trade routes that wind through these distant regions."
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have assured our hegemony over the surrounding Ethiopian areas."
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Ethiopia will be ours!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_1:0 "The Kingdom of Aksum"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_1_DESC:0 "The lands of our neighboring countries would be better managed by us, and that is all the reason we need to claim it. Let our desires be made known throughout the region, and tell our men to gird themselves for battle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil11!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_2:0 "Feeding the People"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_2_DESC:0 "Our farmlands are few, and the rocky hillsides that comprise the core of our lands often have poor yields at harvest. We absolutely must secure the foodstuffs available for our people, especially when one considers the adage that armies march on their stomachs. This has become a matter of national security. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil13!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_3:0 "The Great City of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_3_DESC:0 "Our capital city is already the envy of our neighbors; truly, there are no other cities nearby that can claim to be equal. Yet there is more that we could do; open up the treasury and summon forth the builders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_4:0 "Dominate Aksum"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_4_DESC:0 "The laughable 'Kings' of Mai Adrasha and Daamot have claimed pieces of the province of Aksum as their own, but soon they will know their proper places as your footstools. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil26!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_5:0 "Attacking Tenesis"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_5_DESC:0 "There are many reasons that you desire the province of Tenesis for your own, and access to the waters of the Sinus Arabicus is chief among them. It won't be long before Aksumite ships are sailing from the port of Adouli. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_6:0 "Into Semien"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_6_DESC:0 "We have decided to push our borders to the south; we will not rest until our kingdom touches the waters of Lake Tana. The King of Gwanara shall soon be cast down forevermore. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_7:0 "A Rising State"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_7_DESC:0 "Not content to rest on its laurels, the Kingdom of Aksum invests in itself, knowing that a strong, prosperous homeland is a requisite for future endeavors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_8:0 "Unity of Aksum"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_8_DESC:0 "We have established a realm that is truly worthy of the Aksumites, thanks to the inspiring leadership of our victorious King. The people rejoice and the coins flow into our coffers; hail [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], Lord of Aksum! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil17!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_9:0 "Budding Ivory Trade"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_9_DESC:0 "We are fortunate enough to have access to elephants, and as such, we also produce ivory as a luxury good, albeit in small amounts. With a little bit of investing, we could undoubtedly grow our ivory trade, if we decide to do so. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil20!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_10:0 "Developing Infrastructure"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_10_DESC:0 "The more that we build, the better trained our architects become. Aksumite infrastructure is the best in our region, and we should continue to fund construction as quickly as our funds allow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_11:0 "Coastal Trading"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_11_DESC:0 "We produce a variety of trade goods that are desired the world over, and our people are slowly acquiring a taste for the finer things sold in the markets, as well. The overland routes are profitable but slow going; we should bolster our ability to trade via the Sinus Arabicus. Expand our ports! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil22!"

aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_12:0 "Myrrh Matters"
aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_12_DESC:0 "Myrrh, the valuable trade good that we produce in Matara, always commands a fetching price in the markets, where the demand always outstrips the supply. Might there be something we could do to produce more? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

You are visiting one of the farming communities that you have funded, and you are being given a tour by the local engineers and architects who are quite proud of what they have achieved. As you walk along the canals that carry water into the fields, you can't help but be impressed by the ingenuity of your workers."

'Ah yes, Lord [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].' the architect responds, bowing slightly. 'I think you will be most pleased by this. We have completed designs that greatly expanded our commercial district; people from all over will now flock to the marketplaces of Aksum.' \n\nStanding to your feet, you clap your hands.

me_aksum_nubia_4_desc:0 "After a bloody war, your enemies have been cast down, their power broken forever, and the province of Aksum has been reunited under a single ruler - you. It is unfortunate that so many had to perish in order for this day to come, but you know in your heart that the tough decisions had to be made. Even now, the neighboring kingdoms offer you respect that they previously did not; the glories of the future will be worth the cost paid today."
me_aksum_nubia_4.a:0 "Aksum belongs to me. I have only done what I must"
me_aksum_nubia_4_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_4$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_aksum_nubia_5_title:0 "$aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_5$"
me_aksum_nubia_5_desc:0 "The fortifications at the city of Adouli offer a commanding view of the Sinus Arabicus; you are standing on the battle-scorched battlements, overlooking the chaotic scenes below you. The wars that you recently concluded have scarred this land, yet the damage wrought by your armies will be fixed in time. Even now, teams of men are working to repair the walls; you whistle softly as you watch hundreds of workers setting the massive stone blocks into place. Before long, the harbor will be emptied of construction crews and trading ships will take their places - you can hardly wait."
me_aksum_nubia_5.a:0 "A new chapter in our history begins this day."
me_aksum_nubia_5_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_5$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

me_aksum_nubia_6_title:0 "$aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_6$"
me_aksum_nubia_6_desc:0 "Your campaigns in the lands of Semien have ended, and you have decided to celebrate your victory with a pleasure cruise on Lake Tana now that you have access to this body of water. As you watch the workers loading wine and foodstuffs onto your barge, you can't help but reflect on the winding path that brought you to this moment. Aksum was once just a land of mountains and ravines, yet now we control rivers and valleys - life can be very strange sometimes, with its twists and turns. Lifting a succulent date to your mouth, you chew slowly, relishing in this moment; troubles may come with the dawn, but for now, you are satisfied."
me_aksum_nubia_6.a:0 "We shall bathe in the waters of the Blue Nile"
me_aksum_nubia_6_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y $aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_6$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

It appears that the foresight of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is paying dividends, and the resulting boost in our research will carry us even further than we have already come. This is a day worth celebrating!"

Who else is like our King? All glory to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], all glory to Aksum!"

me_aksum_nubia_9_desc:0 "Recently, you had ordered that the production of ivory be tripled in your kingdom, knowing better than most how valuable the tusks of elephants are, especially after they have been worked over by a master craftsman. After a period of investment, you are incredibly pleased to learn that Aksum is becoming known as a Center of Ivory trading. Some of the goods being produced in your workshops are stunning in their quality; you are particularly fond of an ivory scepter gifted to you by the tradesmen, offered as a thanks for your thoughtful stewardship of this burgeoning industry."
me_aksum_nubia_9.a:0 "What a lovely, thoughtful present!"

me_aksum_nubia_10_title:0 "$aksum_mission_1_ethiopia_task_10$"
me_aksum_nubia_10_desc:0 "Experience is the greatest of teachers, and no one can claim that the architects of Aksum are beginners when it comes to city-building. Although it is difficult to work in the hot and dusty lands that we call home, our men rise to the task admirably, and have learned a couple of tricks along the way; we can utilize these techniques throughout the rest of our kingdom."
me_aksum_nubia_10.a:0 "Be sure to give the workers plenty of beer as a way of saying thanks"

me_aksum_nubia_11_desc:0 "Although our coastlands are deserts, harsh and unwelcoming to strangers, we have done what no others were able to do; by building ports in the wastelands, we have created veritable oases, where merchants and travelers congregate before venturing to other distant places. Our coastal trade is thriving and our treasuries swell with tax incomes; the gods smile upon us."
me_aksum_nubia_11.a:0 "We are slowly becoming wealthy..."

me_aksum_nubia_12_desc:0 "It is said that you can smell the city of Matara before you see it. Following the roads that leave Aksum, one heads northeast, following the rolling hills as they stiffen into mountain peaks. The path becomes more difficult the farther you go, and just when it seems that men and pack animals will faint from exhaustion, their nostrils perk; a sweet fragrance is borne on the dusty winds, your first sign that Matara is within distance. The myrrh produced in its workshops and mills is the lifeblood of the city, ensuring the prosperity of this distant region."
me_aksum_nubia_12.a:0 "Blessed are the Aksumites, for who else has such wealth?"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_2_DESC:0 "Jutting westward, the lands known to the locals as Gash are somewhat desolate and lonesome, sparsely populated by wandering tribesmen that should pose no real threats to us once we have subjugated them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil3!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_3_DESC:0 "It is known that the city of Abliata in the lands of Atbaras is an important stop for the trade routes heading north and south. Whoever controls this city, controls the region; we know what has to be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil7!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_5_DESC:0 "As our influence grows, we find ourselves on a collision course with the power of Kush, who is already showing their unhappiness with our growth. We have reason to believe that conflict between our peoples is inevitable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil23!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_7:0 "Land of the Bow"
aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_7_DESC:0 "Foreigners have given our lands a nickname that reflects our fearsome military prowess, the 'Land of the Bow'. It is true that we have conquered much by the bowstring, so this title is well-deserved, befitting our elegance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil3!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_8:0 "Persuading Alut"
aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_8_DESC:0 "We have decided that it is in Alut's best interest to align their future with ours; whether this is accomplished diplomatically or militarily is entirely up to them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil13!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_11:0 "Arabic Influence"
aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_11_DESC:0 "The Arabic faith grows in our lands, carried by traveling merchants and spreading among our people. There are steps that the state could take to make sure that this process is accelerated, however. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil25!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_12_DESC:0 "In order to properly spread our culture, we need to spread our infrastructure as widely as possible, particularly in the emptier provinces that we have obtained. All of our territories should have the opportunity to prosper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil26!"

aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_13:0 "Plains of Plenty"
aksum_mission_2_nubia_task_13_DESC:0 "These are good lands that we have here, although currently they are underutilized, and this is because we lack the proper resources and manpower to take advantage of nature's gifts.

The fighting outside of Meroe was especially fierce, as the Armies of Kush realized that they would be making their last stand against our forces outside of Meroe's walls. They had hoped to relive their garrison, but in the end, it came down to morale, to sheer willpower...and our armies wanted it more. \n\nYet we did not plan on just subduing Meroe, but we desired to beautify it. Taking away our siege engines from its walls, we instead brought in teams of architects and engineers, trained in the Aksumite manner, to rebuild this city in our image.
