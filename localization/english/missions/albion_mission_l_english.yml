The soldiers are divided in two teams; one is tasked with defense, and the men lock arms and form a shield wall. The opposing side is given spears and ordered to attack their brethren. A general notices our men watching and asks the Captain if we want to train with his men? Of course, nothing is free."

This trader swore that the markets of Tyre rivaled those of Carthage and Rome, and that its port district was one of the best in the Mediterranean. If the temptations of Tyre are not to our liking, then there are other destinations in the Levant that we could explore. The men are tired of wandering, though, and wouldn't mind taking the afternoon to explore the city."
me_albion_travel.9.a: "The marketplace, home of every opportunity."

me_albion_travel.9.c: "We should explore the Levant."

On the bright side, we can spot a shop selling exotic goods from India and Persia, and our men are captivated - never before have they seen ivory, or smelled the fragrant incense that can only be found in the east. And yet, there is a seedy underbelly to the market, as slave traders are always there - it is a pitiful sight to see a naked slave sitting on a mat with a heavy chain around its neck. There are even shops where tinkerers are working on strange contraptions, inventions that they claim can replace slave labor when it comes to certain tasks. Truly, everything that one can imagine is found here."

This port was once the most famous of the world and now, it is in a state of ruins thanks to Alexander and the Diadochi. There are more beggars here than in other places, and the Captain had to tell the men not to give alms to any of the poor souls slumped against the sides of buildings - we would run out of gold before we even reached the plaza.\n\nWhile walking through the dusty streets, a man dressed in armor stepped out from a doorway and called for us to listen to his words. Stranded here after his mercenary company was disbanded after a disasterous campaign, this soldier claims that he has knowledge for sale, and for a 'modest' fee he will join your troupe and give you the military secrets that he learned."
me_albion_travel.92.a: "Just walk on; nothing to see except the glory of old days."

It might be wise to hire a local guide, one that can help us navigate to Tyre or Jerusalem - or even to both. If we have the money, everything is possible."
me_albion_travel.93.a: "Take us to Jerusalem and the Temple"
me_albion_travel.93.b: "Sidon can teach us how to defend a city!"

The Captain has signaled that the hour grows late and our men must return to their ships, but there are some tiny shops near the city gates that have knick knacks and other souveneirs for sale.\n\n'Statues of the sea god to protect your ships upon the waves!' cries out a vendor as he adjusts his merchandise, bringing out folded bundles of clothing and placing them next to a table. 'Tunics to keep you warm at night...get your fresh bread and cheese here, hot bread and cheese.'"
me_albion_travel.94.a: "This last statuette will be so wonderful."

Were the gods angered by our hubris and decided to send our fleet to the bottom of the seas?\n\nOf course, all these options were possible, but with determination and good choices, our fleet finally made it back home. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] called for a period of feasting and celebration to welcome back the intrepid explorers, and the citizens living in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital gave them a hero's welcome."
