Anything and everything that one could ever want is found here in Rome, and our men are tempted by a thousand different activities, each one sounding better than the last.\nThe markets of Rome are known for their rare treasures and goods - is that where we shall spend our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] coin?

But these cases are few and far between, for guards are here, watching to make sure that everything is in order.\n\nThere are many slave markets here and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] always has need for more slaves - should we go there?\nNearby in a plaza, some architects are discussing a drawing that they are looking at. After inquiries are made, it appears that these architects would sell their blueprints to us - maybe a Roman villa in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] would be good?\n\nThe neighing of a stallion breaks this daydream.

But these cases are few and far between, for guards are here, watching to make sure that everything is in order.\n\nOne of the most popular streets is where the slave markets are, and it is known that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] could make good use of them. Yet the glimmer of light on metal catches the eye of the Captain; here are the weaponsmiths, displaying some of the finest swords ever forged.
