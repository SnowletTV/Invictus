#Missions

androphagia_task_1: "Meeting Of The Man-Eaters"
androphagia_task_1_DESC: "As the gentle days of autumn begin to surrender their light and warmth to the harsh embrace of winter, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has summoned the heads of the Great Families to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] in order to discuss the future of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] tribes.\n\nNeutral ground has been chosen for this meeting between the three Tribal Chiefs, and the Androphagian rulers will gather at [GetProvince('(int32)9346').GetName|Y] in order to make a plan for the days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

androphagia_task_2: "The Amber Coast"
androphagia_task_2_DESC: "It has long been known that there is valuable amber @amber! in the primeval forests to the far west, but there are not many who live in such distant places. The land is said to be harsh and unforgiving, with winters that are bitter and harsh and days that are short - the face of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_pajewa').GetName|G] is hidden from the people for many months at a time.\n\nAnd yet it is here that our people must go - the time has come to take over the #T Amber Coast#! and its wealth for ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

androphagia_task_3: "Slaves Of Saicen"
androphagia_task_3_DESC: "The rumors were true - the amber @amber! found in this region is of exceptional quality and has exceeded the lofty expectations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y]. Our tribesmen have been working diligently to gather as much amber as they can, but all the Chieftains are in agreement that a #Y Slave Estate#! is a necessity - there is simply too much work to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

androphagia_task_4: "Settling Soodak"
androphagia_task_4_DESC: "Although our capital is well-stocked with amber @amber!, there remains more to be found and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is prepared to do whatever it takes to secure the future prosperity of our people.\n\nThe islands of [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|Y] is rich and should be ours, but not many people currently live there. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName|Y] has sent word to our tribesmen living along the coasts, calling for volunteers that are willing to leave their settlements and migrate across the water to step forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

androphagia_task_5: "Battling The Black-Cloaks"
androphagia_task_5_DESC: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has full faith in the strength of our levies, it would be foolish to deny that the #Y [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#! are a strong tribe and are more than capable of defending their territories.\n\nBefore we go into battle with any of our neighbors, we should do what we can to seek an ally abroad - the wars to come will be all the easier if we have friends protecting our backs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

androphagia_task_6: "Managing Our Conquests"
androphagia_task_6_DESC: "In the last few years, we have rapidly expanded our borders - something that has made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] proud, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is afraid of provicincial rebellions taking away all of our hard-earned gains. In order to prevent the unthinkable from happening, it has been decided that we should spend some time developing the land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil24!"

androphagia_task_7: "Masters Of The Melanchlaenians"
androphagia_task_7_DESC: "Now that we have conquered the #Y [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!, we must decide the status of these foreigners within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society; should we extend them the hand of friendship or clasp them in fetters and send them to the mines? [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has an important decision to make.\n\n#Y We will decide the#! #G Civic Rights#! #Y for the#! #T [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

androphagia_task_8: "Farming The Forests"
androphagia_task_8_DESC: "Although our people are known to occcasionally consume the flesh of humans, our diets are varied; despite what our many enemies say about us, we raise crops and tend to our herds, just like everyone else does.\n\nIn order to keep our granaries well-stocked and our people fed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for farms to be built throughout our lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

androphagia_task_9: "Riders From The Endless Woodland"
androphagia_task_9_DESC: "Learning how to fight on horseback and guide your mount through the forest is no easy endeavor, but the gods have not given us any other choice - we must either adapt to the terrain we were given or perish. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has commanded our horsemen to train like they are possessed by the gods of war, so that when the time comes to attack our foes, they will be overwhelmed by the speed and fury of our assaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"

androphagia_task_10: "Androphagian Blacksmiths"
androphagia_task_10_DESC: "As our expertise in metalworking and blacksmithing grows, opportunities that were unavailable to us before have become an inevitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"

androphagia_task_11: "The Port Of Anoppi"
androphagia_task_11_DESC: "There are many good reasons that a port should be built at [GetProvince('(int32)9373').GetName|Y]; it is close to the profitable amber @amber! sources in our forests, which will be wonderful for our trade, and there is a small natural harbor there that would be easy for our engineers to expand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

androphagia_task_12: "Sailing The Sarmaticus"
androphagia_task_12_DESC: "As our countrymen have become more and more familiar with the treacherous waters of the #Y Oceanus Sarmaticus#!, we have learned of many amber @amber! producing settlements to our south. It is said that the quality of the fine jewelry produced there rivals our own - something that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] refuses to believe.\n\nRather than allowing rivals in the amber trade to exist alongside us, our indomitable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has declared that we shall subdue the coast for the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|G].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

androphagia_task_13: "Cannibal City"
androphagia_task_13_DESC: "As our name and fame spread throughout the civilized world, we have learned that Greek cartographers have dismissively called our main settlement '#G Androphagopolis#!', or '#R Cannibal City#!', on their maps. It is obvious that they think that we are barbarians, and we are often the butt of many of their jokes - there are many plays performed in the theaters of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|Y] that portray Androphagians as ignorant savages.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is not bothered by these insults, but, on the contrary, has vowed to build a city that rivals any found in the kingdoms of the haughty Greeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

androphagia_task_14: "The Amber Circuit"
androphagia_task_14_DESC: "In order to facilitate the smooth transportation of amber @amber! to and from our port in [GetProvince('(int32)9372').GetName|Y], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is seeking to raise the funds required for building a road that will connect the settlements of the #T Amber Coast#! together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"

androphagia_task_15: "Riches Beyond Measure"
androphagia_task_15_DESC: "Slowly but surely, we have become the undisputed masters of the amber @amber! trade; the prices that are set in the markets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have become the standard throughout the civilized world. Ships from as far away as [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetName|Y] have sailed to our waters in order to barter with our merchants directly; a testament to the prestige of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

androphagia_task_16: "Silver Shrine Of The Sun"
androphagia_task_16_DESC: "In order to entice the goddess [GetDeityDefinition('omen_pajewa').GetName|G] to remember us and bless us with her countenance in this grey and dismal land, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for a #E Great Temple#! to be built within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] - a #T Silver Shrine of the Sun#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

androphagia_task_17: "Teeth Of Iron"
androphagia_task_17_DESC: "There is a frustrating lack of iron @iron! in the great northern forests that cover much of our territories, and this makes the metal that is found at [GetProvince('(int32)8466').GetName|Y] all the more valuable.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has visions of equipping our soldiers with new arms in order to give them the edge in battle, but we must make sure that we have the required supplies on hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

androphagia_task_18: "A Bit Of The Old Smash And Grab"
androphagia_task_18_DESC: "The life of a migratory tribe is never an easy one; our neighbors usually view us with a mixture of fear and loathing, and once they learn that we eat the flesh of humans, then it becomes quite difficult to earn their trust and friendship - and trade. Merchants will go out of their way to avoid our encampments, taking longer routes in order to avoid passing through our territory.\n\nWhen presented with such difficult circumstances, our people have usually relied on...less savory ways to make money. And times have never been harder for the tribesmen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|G]. Fortunately for us, we have heard of many rich cities in the south - towns that are fabulously wealthy, but have failed to invest in city walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil17!"

androphagia_task_19: "Anatolian Assaults"
androphagia_task_19_DESC: "Our successful raids throughout #T Taurica#! have given our levies a taste for ill-gotten gains and plunder, and the stories told by our Bosporan slaves of the wealth found in #G Anatolia#! have nearly driven our men mad with desire.\n\nIn order to satiate the bloodlust of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] men, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has given permission for our warbands to plunder the undefended cities of the south, consequences be damned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"

androphagia_task_20: "A Hunger For Brains"
androphagia_task_20_DESC: "Although we have constructed illustrious #G Academies#! within our capital, there is a noticeable lack of qualified teachers working and teaching within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|T], much to our everlasting shame.\n\nNow that we have a proper navy and the means to do something about it, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for an expedition to the great cities of the Mediterranean - [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetName|T], [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetName|T] - in order to see if we can recruit any great minds to come live within our realm.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

androphagia_task_21: "A Question Of Honor"
androphagia_task_21_DESC: "Some of our kinsmen are insinuating that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has lived a pampered life over the last few years, spending [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] time issuing orders and decrees from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|G] instead of fighting alongside our soldiers like a real Androphagian warrior.\n\nIn order to silence these naysayers and prove that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has not grown soft, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName|Y] has vowed to duel a rival in personal combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil9!"

androphagia_task_22: "Devourers Of The World"
androphagia_task_22_DESC: "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil11!"
