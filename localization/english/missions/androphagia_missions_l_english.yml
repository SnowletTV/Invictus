androphagia: "Day Of The Cannibals"
androphagia_DESCRIPTION: "There are few living who know the way to the lands where the tribes of the migratory #E Androphagians#! make their home, and the handful of #E Scythian#! traders that know the way to their encampments will often refuse to divulge this information, even if large quantities of silver and gold are offered.\n\nThis reluctance to travel up the #E River Borysthenes#! can perhaps be traced to the shared histories between the two tribes; hundreds of years ago, when the armies of #E Darius the Persian#! invaded Scythia with his renowned general #E Megazabus#! at his side, the Androphagians refused to come to the defense of the tribesmen when the Scythians called for aid, and these bitter memories of betrayal have not been forgotten.\n\nPerhaps another reason that the Androphagians are left to their own devices is their penchant for devouring human flesh; the name given to them by the Greeks literally means 'Man-Eaters'. While cannibalism is occasionally utilized in their religious practices, they have unfairly earned a reputation for being savage cannibals that flay the flesh off of the living and drink the blood of their victims - a dubious distinction that is misinformed, yet one that they do not seem to mind."
androphagia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the migratory Androphagians, after raiding and destroying the lands of their enemies, have established a mighty #E Steppe Horde#! that will rule unchallenged."

#Missions

androphagia_task_1: "Meeting Of The Man-Eaters"
androphagia_task_1_DESC: "As the gentle days of autumn begin to surrender their light and warmth to the harsh embrace of winter, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has summoned the heads of the Great Families to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] in order to discuss the future of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] tribes.\n\nNeutral ground has been chosen for this meeting between the three Tribal Chiefs, and the Androphagian rulers will gather at [GetProvince('(int32)9346').GetName|Y] in order to make a plan for the days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

androphagia_task_2: "A Western Capital"
androphagia_task_2_DESC: "It has long been known that there is valuable amber @amber! in the primeval forests to the far west, but there are not many who live in such distant places. The land is said to be harsh and unforgiving, with winters that are bitter and harsh and days that are short - the face of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_pajewa').GetName|G] is hidden from the people for many months at a time.\n\nAnd yet it is here that our people must go - the time has come to take over the #T Amber Coast#! and its wealth for ourselves. We might even consecrate a western capital...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

androphagia_task_3: "Slaves Of Saicen"
androphagia_task_3_DESC: "The rumors were true - the amber @amber! found in this region is of exceptional quality and has exceeded the lofty expectations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y]. Our tribesmen have been working diligently to gather as much amber as they can, but all the Chieftains are in agreement that a #Y Slave Estate#! is a necessity - there is simply too much work to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

androphagia_task_4: "Settling Soodak"
androphagia_task_4_DESC: "Although our capital is well-stocked with amber @amber!, there remains more to be taken and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is prepared to do whatever it takes to secure the future prosperity of our people.\n\nThe islands of [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|Y] are rich and belong to us, but not many people currently live there. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName|Y] has sent word to our tribesmen living along the coasts, calling for volunteers that are willing to leave their settlements and migrate across the water to step forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

androphagia_task_5: "Battling The Black-Cloaks"
androphagia_task_5_DESC: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has full faith in the strength of our levies, it would be foolish to deny that the #E #G [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!#! are a strong tribe and are more than capable of defending their territories.\n\nBefore we go into battle with any of our neighbors, we should do what we can to seek an ally abroad - the wars to come will be all the easier if we have friends protecting our backs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

androphagia_task_6: "Managing Our Conquests"
androphagia_task_6_DESC: "In the last few years, we have rapidly expanded our borders - something that has made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] proud, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is afraid of provicincial rebellions taking away all of our hard-earned gains. In order to prevent the unthinkable from happening, it has been decided that we should spend some time developing the land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil24!"

androphagia_task_7: "Masters Of The Melanchlaenians"
androphagia_task_7_DESC: "Now that we have conquered the #Y [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!, we must decide the status of these foreigners within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society; should we extend them the hand of friendship or clasp them in fetters and send them to the mines? [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has an important decision to make.\n\n#Y We will decide the#! #G Civic Rights#! #Y for the#! #T [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

androphagia_task_8: "Farming The Forests"
androphagia_task_8_DESC: "Although our people are known to occcasionally consume the flesh of humans, our diets are varied; despite what our many enemies say about us, we raise crops and tend to our herds, just like everyone else does.\n\nIn order to keep our granaries well-stocked and our people fed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for farms to be built throughout our lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

androphagia_task_9: "Riders From The Endless Woodlands"
androphagia_task_9_DESC: "Learning how to fight on horseback and guide your mount through the forest is no easy endeavor, but the gods have not given us any other choice - we must either adapt to the terrain we were given or perish. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has commanded our horsemen to train like they are possessed by the gods of war, so that when the time comes to attack our foes, they will be overwhelmed by the speed and fury of our assaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"

androphagia_task_10: "Androphagian Blacksmiths"
androphagia_task_10_DESC: "As our expertise in metalworking and blacksmithing grows, opportunities that were unavailable to us before have become an inevitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"

androphagia_task_11: "The Port Of Anoppi"
androphagia_task_11_DESC: "There are many good reasons that a port should be built at [GetProvince('(int32)9373').GetName|Y]; it is close to the profitable amber @amber! sources in our forests, which will be wonderful for our trade, and there is a small natural harbor there that would be easy for our engineers to expand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

androphagia_task_12: "Sailing The Sarmaticus"
androphagia_task_12_DESC: "As our countrymen have become more and more familiar with the treacherous waters of the #Y Oceanus Sarmaticus#!, we have learned of many amber @amber! producing settlements to our south. It is said that the quality of the fine jewelry produced there rivals our own - something that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] refuses to believe.\n\nRather than allowing rivals in the amber trade to exist alongside us, our indomitable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has declared that we shall subdue the coast for the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|G].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

androphagia_task_13: "Cannibal City"
androphagia_task_13_DESC: "As our name and fame spread throughout the civilized world, we have learned that Greek cartographers have dismissively called our main settlement '#G Androphagopolis#!', or '#R Cannibal City#!', on their maps. It is obvious that they think that we are barbarians, and we are often the butt of many of their jokes - there are many plays performed in the theaters of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|Y] that portray Androphagians as ignorant savages.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is not bothered by these insults, but, on the contrary, has vowed to build a city that rivals any found in the kingdoms of the haughty Greeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

androphagia_task_14: "The Amber Circuit"
androphagia_task_14_DESC: "In order to facilitate the smooth transportation of amber @amber! to and from our port in [GetProvince('(int32)9372').GetName|T], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is seeking to raise the funds required for building a road that will connect the settlements of the #T Amber Coast#! together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"

androphagia_task_15: "Riches Beyond Measure"
androphagia_task_15_DESC: "Slowly but surely, we have become the undisputed masters of the amber @amber! trade; the prices that are set in the markets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have become the standard throughout the civilized world. Ships from as far away as [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetName|Y] have sailed to our waters in order to barter with our merchants directly; a testament to the prestige of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

androphagia_task_16: "Silver Shrine Of The Sun"
androphagia_task_16_DESC: "In order to entice the goddess [GetDeityDefinition('omen_pajewa').GetName|G] to remember us and bless us with her countenance in this grey and dismal land, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for a #E Great Temple#! to be built within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] - a #T Silver Shrine of the Sun#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

androphagia_task_17: "Teeth Of Iron"
androphagia_task_17_DESC: "There is a frustrating lack of iron @iron! in the great northern forests that cover much of our territories, and this makes the metal that is found at [GetProvince('(int32)8466').GetName|Y] all the more valuable.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has visions of equipping our soldiers with new arms in order to give them the edge in battle, but we must make sure that we have the required supplies on hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

androphagia_task_18: "A Bit Of The Old Smash And Grab"
androphagia_task_18_DESC: "The life of a migratory tribe is never an easy one; our neighbors usually view us with a mixture of fear and loathing, and once they learn that we eat the flesh of humans, then it becomes quite difficult to earn their trust and friendship - and trade. Merchants will go out of their way to avoid our encampments, taking longer routes in order to avoid passing through our territory.\n\nWhen presented with such difficult circumstances, our people have usually relied on...less savory ways to make money. And times have never been harder for the tribesmen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|R]. Fortunately for us, we have heard of many rich cities in the south - towns that are fabulously wealthy, but have failed to invest in city walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil17!"

androphagia_task_19: "Anatolian Assaults"
androphagia_task_19_DESC: "Our successful raids throughout #T Taurica#! have given our levies a taste for ill-gotten gains and plunder, and the stories told by our Bosporan slaves of the wealth found in #G Anatolia#! have nearly driven our men mad with desire.\n\nIn order to satiate the bloodlust of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] men, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has given permission for our warbands to plunder the undefended cities of the south, consequences be damned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"

androphagia_task_20: "A Hunger For Brains"
androphagia_task_20_DESC: "Although we have constructed illustrious #G Academies#! within our capital, there is a noticeable lack of qualified teachers working and teaching within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|T], much to our everlasting shame.\n\nNow that we have a proper navy and the means to do something about it, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for an expedition to the great cities of the Mediterranean - [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetName|T], [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)516').GetName|T] - in order to see if we can recruit any great minds to come live within our realm.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

androphagia_task_21: "A Question Of Honor"
androphagia_task_21_DESC: "Some of our kinsmen are insinuating that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has lived a pampered life over the last few years, spending [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] time issuing orders and decrees from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|G] instead of fighting alongside our soldiers like a real Androphagian warrior.\n\nIn order to silence these naysayers and prove that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has not grown soft, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName|Y] has vowed to duel a rival in personal combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil9!"

androphagia_task_22: "The Crimson Horde"
androphagia_task_22_DESC: "The ancient civilizations of the world tremble at the mere mention of our name - our warriors are the destroyers of cities and the bloodthirsty devourers of the innocent. May the smoke of burning temples and villages and the stench of roasting flesh fill the air as #E #R The Crimson Horde#!#! consumes all that stand before us! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil21!"

androphagia_task_23: "The Wild Hunt"
androphagia_task_23_DESC: "The stresses of ruling over our kinsmen have started to get to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y], so when a group of friends dropped by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] quarters unnannounced with a proposition, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] decided that a few days of relaxation was sorely needed.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil7!"

androphagia_task_24: "Devourers Of Civilization"
androphagia_task_24_DESC: "The accomplishments of the #G Greeks#! are known to our tribesmen, even though our homeland is thousands of miles away from their distant cities. It is said that none are their equals when it comes to matters of civilization, and, having heard this, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] desired to unleash our raiders upon them and destroy everything that they had ever accomplished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"

androphagia_task_25: "Ivory Throne Of The Moon"
androphagia_task_25_DESC: "[GetDeityDefinition('omen_kuje').GetName|G] has visited [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] in a dream with an urgent request; in order to secure the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|G] and ensure that our people rule over the realm for the next thousand years, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] must construct a special fortress that will serve as the #T Ivory Throne of the Moon Goddess#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil23!"

androphagia_task_26: "The Invasion Of Scythia"
androphagia_task_26_DESC: "Now that we have shattered the might of the #Y [GetCountry('MLN').GetName]ns#!, our Chieftains have set their sights on destroying the #E #G [GetCountry('SCY').GetName]ns#!#! that live to our south. Although we did not wish to involve ourselves in their affairs, we cannot allow a powerful tribal confederacy to exist in our periphery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"

androphagia_task_27: "Chief Of Chiefs"
androphagia_task_27_DESC: "As the cities and temples of the #Y Greeks#! burn to ashes, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has called for a #E #R Grand Invasion of the Steppe#!#! in order to prove Androphagian supremacy once and for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

androphagia_task_28: "Scythian Sons And Soldiers"
androphagia_task_28_DESC: "With the subjugation and destruction of the #E #G [GetCountry('SCY').GetName]ns#!#! all but assured, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] has ordered that their nobility should move to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|T] at once. The relocation of the leading families has assisted the Androphagian [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] next effort to usurp Scythian power; the best warriors from their tribes will be gathered into one army and forced to fight for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil15!"

androphagian_1_desc: "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] first sent word to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] counterparts requesting a meeting, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetName] were suspicious of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]'s intentions and asked to meet in the wilderness, far from the levies living near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. When the appointed day arrived, the three rode out to the borders of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and met each other in the forest. They all remained on horseback, each cautiously looking at the others.\n\n'Why have you summoned us here, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]?' growled [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFirstName]. 'There is much work to be done preparing for the winter - the days grow short, as does my patience for such gatherings.'\n\n'Hold your tongue and remember your place, son of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]s, and listen to my words. I did not summon you here without purpose.'\n\nLately, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had been receiving strange visions in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] dreams, and after consulting with the Wise One, the meaning of these nightmares was revealed. A period of chaos would soon be unleashed upon the world; empires would shatter and be born anew, and the Androphagians, forgotten by all on the fringes of the world, would prosper in the days to come, but only if bold action was taken.\n\n'As the leaders of our people, we are responsible for what happens to Androphagia. The gods have commanded us to grasp the moment, and yet I fail to see what it is that we should accomplish.'\n\n'War.' croaked [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFirstName] in a grim voice, spitting on the ground. 'Let us ride south and burn the cities of [GetCountry('MLN').GetName] and enslave their women and children.'\n\nShaking his head in disagreement, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetFirstName] spoke for the first time. 'I, too, have seen visions, of endless waters to the west, in a land where unimagined wealth waits for our tribes.' Fumbling in his robes, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetFirstName] pulled out a small amber @amber! trinket; a graven image of a small bear that hung around his neck. 'It is known that amber can be found in the western forests - we should discover the source for ourselves.'\n\nAt that very moment, a chill wind blew through the shaded forest, and the first snowflakes of the season began to fall. Shivering in spite of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] looked to the skies and spoke in a soft voice."

'If you thirst and hunger, then drink each other's blood and eat each other's flesh, Man-Eaters.'\n\nRealizing that they would all die without sustenance, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] offered to pay outrageous prices for bread and water, and the greedy Alexandrians took our gold. Yet the amphorae they sent abroad our ships were in bad condition; the water they gave us smelled of animals and the bread was hard as rocks and moldy. When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] complained loudly about this violation of trust, the Alexandrians opened fire on our ships, forcing our men to sail away.\n\nTurning back towards the famed #E Lighthouse#! as the city shrank into the distance, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] swore a mighty oath and promised to avenge the honor of the Androphagians."

Naturally, our men made a few stops along the shores of Africa on their way back - the putrid foodstuffs and water sold to us by the perfidious Alexandrians were inedible, and our sailors were forced to raid and pillage Egyptian settlements along the coasts in order to restock our suppplies.\n\nThe wrath of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was something to behold, and even those closest to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] were stunned by how aggressively [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] attacked the people living along the African coastline. Entire villages were taken prisoner and thrown into the depths of the Androphagian ships, and anyone that spoke with an Alexandrian accent was eaten alive by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] - no mercy was shown to anyone, regardless of their age or condition.\n\nOnce they learned what the Androphagians were up to in their hinterlands, the stunned Alexandrians tried to mount a counter defense and sent a war fleet in hopes of catching us, but our navy was able to throw them off of their trail and managed to escape. The pirates living near the #E Pillars of Herakles#! did not bother us again on the trip home, and a couple of years after they first set sail, our armada made it back to the borders controlled by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nThe long voyage home did nothing to assuage the anger of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], however, and even after many weeks had passed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] could not believe everything that had happened."
