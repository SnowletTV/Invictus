 androphagia:0 "Day Of The Cannibals"
 androphagia_DESCRIPTION:0 "There are few living who know the way to the lands where the tribes of the migratory #E Androphagians#! make their home, and the handful of #E Scythian#! traders that know the way to their encampments will often refuse to divulge this information, even if large quantities of silver and gold are offered.\n\nThis reluctance to travel up the #E River Borysthenes#! can perhaps be traced to the shared histories between the two tribes; hundreds of years ago, when the armies of #E Darius the Persian#! invaded Scythia with his renowned general #E Megazabus#! at his side, the Androphagians refused to come to the defense of the tribesmen when the Scythians called for aid, and these bitter memories of betrayal have not been forgotten.\n\nPerhaps another reason that the Androphagians are left to their own devices is their penchant for devouring human flesh; the name given to them by the Greeks literally means 'Man-Eaters'. While cannibalism is occasionally utilized in their religious practices, they have unfairly earned a reputation for being savage cannibals that flay the flesh off of the living and drink the blood of their victims - a dubious distinction that is misinformed, yet one that they do not seem to mind."
 androphagia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when the migratory Androphagians, after raiding and destroying the lands of their enemies, have established a mighty #E Steppe Horde#! that will rule unchallenged."

 androphagia_task_6:0 "Managing Our Conquests"
 androphagia_task_6_DESC:0 "In the last few years, we have rapidly expanded our borders - something that has made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] proud, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is afraid of provicincial rebellions taking away all of our hard-earned gains.

It is obvious that they think that we are barbarians, and we are often the butt of many of their jokes - there are many plays performed in the theaters of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|Y] that portray Androphagians as ignorant savages.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] is not bothered by these insults, but, on the contrary, has vowed to build a city that rivals any found in the kingdoms of the haughty Greeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 androphagia_task_18:0 "A Bit Of The Old Smash And Grab"
 androphagia_task_18_DESC:0 "The life of a migratory tribe is never an easy one; our neighbors usually view us with a mixture of fear and loathing, and once they learn that we eat the flesh of humans, then it becomes quite difficult to earn their trust and friendship - and trade. Merchants will go out of their way to avoid our encampments, taking longer routes in order to avoid passing through our territory.\n\nWhen presented with such difficult circumstances, our people have usually relied on...less savory ways to make money. And times have never been harder for the tribesmen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|R].

 androphagian_1_desc:0 "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] first sent word to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] counterparts requesting a meeting, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetName] were suspicious of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]'s intentions and asked to meet in the wilderness, far from the levies living near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. When the appointed day arrived, the three rode out to the borders of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and met each other in the forest. They all remained on horseback, each cautiously looking at the others.\n\n'Why have you summoned us here, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]?' growled [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFirstName]. 'There is much work to be done preparing for the winter - the days grow short, as does my patience for such gatherings.'\n\n'Hold your tongue and remember your place, son of the [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]s, and listen to my words. I did not summon you here without purpose.'\n\nLately, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had been receiving strange visions in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] dreams, and after consulting with the Wise One, the meaning of these nightmares was revealed. A period of chaos would soon be unleashed upon the world; empires would shatter and be born anew, and the Androphagians, forgotten by all on the fringes of the world, would prosper in the days to come, but only if bold action was taken.\n\n'As the leaders of our people, we are responsible for what happens to Androphagia. The gods have commanded us to grasp the moment, and yet I fail to see what it is that we should accomplish.'\n\n'War.' croaked [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_one').GetFirstName] in a grim voice, spitting on the ground. 'Let us ride south and burn the cities of [GetCountry('MLN').GetName] and enslave their women and children.'\n\nShaking his head in disagreement, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetFirstName] spoke for the first time. 'I, too, have seen visions, of endless waters to the west, in a land where unimagined wealth waits for our tribes.' Fumbling in his robes, [SCOPE.sCharacter('clan_chief_two').GetFirstName] pulled out a small amber @amber! trinket; a graven image of a small bear that hung around his neck. 'It is known that amber can be found in the western forests - we should discover the source for ourselves.'\n\nAt that very moment, a chill wind blew through the shaded forest, and the first snowflakes of the season began to fall. Shivering in spite of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] looked to the skies and spoke in a soft voice."
