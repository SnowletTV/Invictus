antigonid_invictus_2: "The Fate of Egypt"
antigonid_invictus_2_DESC: "Now that the forces of Ptolemy have been crushed, we must decide what to do with the Egyptian territories that he poached for himself."
antigonid_invictus_3: "The Fate of Babylon"
antigonid_invictus_3_DESC: "Although it seems like a lifetime ago, we once listened to Alexander giving orders in the Halls of Babylon - now, it is time for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to call the shots again." # Antigonos was briefly in Babylon 
antigonid_invictus_4: "The Fate of Thrace"
antigonid_invictus_4_DESC: "We must now turn our attention to the erstwhile holdings of Lysimachos in the land of Thrace, but be mindful of his barbarian thralls to the north in Odrysia - they are conniving and not to be trusted."
antigonid_invictus_5: "The Macedonian Homeland"
antigonid_invictus_5_DESC: "We should do what we can to restore order to Macedonia, and opening up our treasuries and beautifying our homeland with construction initiatives is a time-tested way to do so."
antigonid_invictus_6: "A Stable Realm"
antigonid_invictus_6_DESC: "Although we rule over a disparate people, one bounded together by Antigonid strength more than natural affinity for each other, we still have managed to bring stability to our vast realm."
antigonid_invictus_7: "Syrian Governance" #yes, alluding the Seleukid mission task
antigonid_invictus_7_DESC: "Let us govern Syria in a way that will shame the Seleukid ambitions." # they want to have it; they didn't own it until after the 4th diadochi wars
antigonid_invictus_8: "Riches of Cilicia"
antigonid_invictus_8_DESC: "Although the Anatolian Plateau is dry and dusty, the fertile farmlands of Cilicia provide untold riches for those who can master the earth and the sea."
antigonid_invictus_9: "Restoring Ancient Tyana"

antigonid_invictus_10: "Strategos of Asia"
antigonid_invictus_10_DESC: "By right of the spear, we can truly claim the title of 'Strategos of Asia', but a competent ruler invests in the recently conquered; let us not be found wanting, but do what we can to help the local populace."
antigonid_invictus_11: "Satrap of Phrygia"
antigonid_invictus_11_DESC: "The all-important region of Phrygia can either be a boon to us or a weight around our necks, dragging us down into disaster - let us do what we can to make sure that the former happens, and the entire nation will benefit."
antigonid_invictus_12: "Old Capital"
antigonid_invictus_12_DESC: "Once the seat of [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetName], the Antigonid adminsitration had left [GetProvince('(int32)1936')GetName] in favour of [GetProvince('(int32)790')GetName] once we had conquered Syria."

me_antigonid_1_vision.200.desc: "When #E Alexandros#!, spiralling deeper the depths of a fever that he would never recover from, weakly murmured 'To the strongest...' while on his deathbed, few knew at the time that this was a prophecy, one that foretold the hour of triumph that now sees [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] standing atop the other Diadochi.\n\nThe other Successors and their bedraggled levies have been driven from the battlefield, abandoned by both mercenary and friends, and even now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] agents pursue their family members to the very ends of the Earth. Soon, there will be no one left that has a claim to the sundered empire of Alexandros, save the brilliant general who forged the pieces together - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], may [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] live forever."

me_antigonid_1_vision.201.a: "The divine has never left us." # alluding Alexander's opinions re:divinity in Egypt

me_antigonid_1_vision.202.t: "The Mesopotamian Way of Life"
me_antigonid_1_vision.202.desc: "At long last, the pathetic forces of #E Seleukos#! have been scattered like the cowards we knew them to be, with the broken strength of the Babylonian Usurper being pushed deep into the barbarous hinterlands of the territories he was squatting upon.\n\nNow, as the victorious soldiers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] triumphantly enter through the Gates of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName] to the shouted acclaim of its inhabitants, one thought possesses the mind of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]."
me_antigonid_1_vision.202.a: "We now possess the beating heart of civilization, with all that this entails"

me_antigonid_1_vision.203.t: "The Thracians"
me_antigonid_1_vision.203.desc: "A growing crowd in [GetProvince('(int32)350').GetName] is standing behind the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldiers, nervously watching as they post the new laws and regulations that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has commanded be enforced throughout the entirety of #E Thrace#!.\n\nNow that Lysimachos has been neutered and the perpetual thorns in his side, the Odrysian barbarians, have had their jaws broken, an era of peace and prosperity will soon come to this troubled region."
me_antigonid_1_vision.203.a: "We have tamed the wild barbarians."

me_antigonid_1_vision.204.t: "The Homeland"
me_antigonid_1_vision.204.desc: "Our engineers report that the work that they started at [GetProvince('(int32)379').GetName] is, at long last, complete, and the birthplace of Alexandros is now the newest metropolis in the region of Macedonia.\n\nWhat better way to announce before gods and man that the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName] is the true, legitimate rulers of all Greece? Who can see what we have accomplished here and not acknowledge that a new era has come?"
me_antigonid_1_vision.204.a: "We have secured our legitimacy."

me_antigonid_1_vision.205.t: "A Stable Realm"
me_antigonid_1_vision.205.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is allowing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self a glass of the finest wine available in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and with good reason - for once, all seems to be at ease in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]; there are no pressing concerns that need to be dealt with today, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is allowed a moment to reflect on all that has been accomplished.\n\n'What is more difficult?' [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] muses to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self, drinking deeply from a golden rhyton. 'Catching an enemy unawares and taking an empire in a handful of battles, or having to conquer bitter foes that surround you on all sides? The Achaemenids were a worthy foe, but what I have achieved in reuniting a broken kingdom is far greater.'"
me_antigonid_1_vision.205.a: "Alexandros, I have surpassed you..."

me_antigonid_1_vision.206.t: "Syrian Ambitions"
me_antigonid_1_vision.206.desc: "At great expense, both in time and gold, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] engineers have managed to build a local road network that connects the scattered cities of #E Syria#!. Merchants will be able to travel easily between the markets, but our soldiers will also be able to use these roads as necessary, quelling uprisings as they may happen.\n\nWe have achieved something momentous here, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]; there should be celebrations in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] tonight."
me_antigonid_1_vision.206.a: "We shall hold the cities of Syria close to our hearts"

me_antigonid_1_vision.207.t: "Cilician Trade"
me_antigonid_1_vision.207.desc: "We are pleased to report to you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], that the productive farmlands of Cilicia are living up to their reputation. Not only are we able to feed many people with the agricultural bounty that the gods provide to us, but we are also selling the surplus at distant markets.\n\nIf not for the port cities that you had ordered be built, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], then we would not be in this position, so we owe you many thanks."
me_antigonid_1_vision.207.a: "Trade networks are the veins and sinews of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"

me_antigonid_1_vision.208.t: "Old Tyana"
me_antigonid_1_vision.208.desc: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been too busy to personally visit Old [GetProvince('(int32)1951').GetName], the regional capital that the #E Achaemenids#! used as an administrative site for their province of #E Phyrgia#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has been following news of the efforts to restore the city.\n\nTyana has been through a lot; the walls of its citadels are battle-scorched and its defenses were crumbling, but hopefully the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Era will see it ascend to new, unimagined heights."
me_antigonid_1_vision.208.a: "Tell my engineers that I am quite pleased in what they have done"

me_antigonid_1_vision.209.t: "Strategos Of Asia"
me_antigonid_1_vision.209.desc: "As of late, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] seems to be an unstoppable force - not only has [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] invariably gotten the best of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] foes on the battlefield, but even the recently conquered are submitting to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] authority. Not one to rest on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] laurels, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has announced [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] intentions to build cities all throughout #E Asia#!."
me_antigonid_1_vision.209.a: "No one can stand against me! My destiny is to rule the Earth!"

me_antigonid_1_vision.210.t: "The Phrygian Satrapy"
me_antigonid_1_vision.210.desc: "Good news follows [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wherever [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] goes; an unassailable sign of some divinity casting a protective eye over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]. The Phrygians have quietly assumed a subservient state, sending their sons to fight in our armies and allowing our architects to build new cities on their territories.\n\nIt seems that no one will be able to stop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
me_antigonid_1_vision.210.a: "Our supreme victory is an inevitability..."

me_antigonid_1_vision.211.t: "Kelainai, the Old Capital"
me_antigonid_1_vision.211.desc: "[GetProvince('(int32)1936').GetName] is a most excellent place for an [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] administrative center; situated at a crossroads, it allows easy access to the interior of Anatolia, and the sea is only a few day's ride.\n\nAlthough the importance of Kelainai has never been forgotten, the efforts undertaken by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to restore it to its former state will have repurcussions throughout the entire region."
