 me_argos_1_desc:0 "At the instigation of certain female members of your household, who had decided amongst themselves that an unmarried Archon of Argos was simply an intolerable state of affairs, you have agreed to send an envoy to Macedon in hopes of finding a suitable bride. As the weeks went on, you had quite forgotten about the entire matter, seeking mostly to quiet the nagging of your extended family, and were quite surprised one afternoon when your advisors tell you that not one, but three Antipatrid brides have been sent to Argos; Kassandros must really like you! They are waiting in a villa to meet you, so you splash some water on your face and head down to where they are staying - you will have the evening meal with them.\n\n You are immediately tongue-tied when you are finally in their presence, the irony of which is not lost upon you; how funny it is that such a great orator as yourself, used to giving rousing speeches before the Assemblies, are at a loss for words. Each woman is exceedingly beautiful and exceptionally intelligent, and the conversation lasts for hours before their chaperones excuse them for the evening. You are left alone on your couch, head spinning with wine and the excitement of your possibilities; this will be a difficult decision."

It seems that their Archon, an ambitious young fellow that you have already heard a great deal about, has humbly requested that we send a royal bride to him. He comes from a good family, you are told, and this gesture would certainly solidify your reputation in Argos. And while there are certainly a number of unmarried women in our family, do we want to send such a gift to the Argives? Are they truly worthy?"

You hear the wedding celebration was one for the ages, though, and your friend in Argos is certainly pleased with you."
 me_argos_3_desc_2:0 "The embassy we sent to Argos returns with frustrating news, and now three women of your family stand before you, faces red from crying and demanding vengeance. It seems that, after all of this discussion about sending a bride to Argos, negotiations fell through at the last minute, and now you have three embarrassed women berating you. With everything going on at the moment, this is a distraction to be sure, but you are not happy - not happy at all. You send your kinfolk away with vague promises and remind yourself to deal with the Argives later."

Argos grows exponentially, but you would never be able to tell that our capital is the heart of a burgeoning empire by looking at it. Taking the advice of your ministers to heart, you ordered the treasury opened and sent your architects into the streets of Argos, expanding the residential and commercial districts.

Lovesick poets have written numerous odes praising the beauty of our capital, which truly stands out when compared to all of the other cities in Greece - you are particularly fond of the epic poem 'A City Unlike No Other', and the streets are plastered with graffiti that quotes lines from this and other celebrated works.

Alas, it seems that while the emulate many Argive good traits, their sense of pride has apparently not been extinguished.

The small-minded might say what I am proposing is treason...I cannot do this alone; I must seek support among those who think like me, in order to give my claims legitimacy."
 
 
 # HEY ZORGO BALL, WRITE 3 MORE DESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE me_argos_20_desc DESCRIPTION SO THIS EVENT HAS MORE VARIETY, THANKS.
 me_argos_20_desc_2:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has seemed preoccupied the last few days, refusing to divulge what is on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind. Despite this minor distraction, as irritable moods are a rare thing for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], life goes on, as usual, at the capital. The endless debates in the Gerousia continue, the streets are filled with merchants and tradesmen, and the common people go about their days. The less ambitious might even be satisfied by this state.\n\nYet heads would certainly turn if they knew the real reason that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] seems anxious; as we speak, secret emissaries have been sent to [target.GetName], hoping to build support for a change in government. Even now, our campaign of whispers continues..."
 me_argos_20_desc_3:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that the support of [target.GetName] will be a requirement moving forward, as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cannot hope to stand on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] own two legs when the time for rebellion is at hand. Still, it is known that [target.GetFirstName] is a faithful sort, although [target.GetHerHis] loyalty could certainly be purchased. As with everything in life, there are no promises."
 me_argos_20_desc_4:0 "'You are aware of what you are proposing, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]?' [target.GetName] reclines back onto a couch, a fierce twinkle in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] eyes. The hour is late; all of the household slaves are asleep, save for the one attendant sleepily standing in the doorway. 'Don't worry about Phaedo; he's deaf.' [target.GetName] states matter of factly. 'He won't run off to the Gerousia to report what you are saying.' \n\n'What do you say then, [target.GetFirstName]? Your support will be vital for what is to come.'"
 me_argos_20.a:0 "A small sum is all that is needed"
 me_argos_20.b:0 "[target.GetName] will need more to be convinced"
 
 me_argos_21_title:0 "Response from [target.GetName]"
 me_argos_21_desc_success:0 "You have sent a trusted advisor to [target.GetName], asking them to clandestinely support your attempt to overthrow the Gerousia and install yourself as Basileus. You must admit that you are surprised when [target.GetFirstName] shows up in person at your home one evening, face hidden underneath the folds of their long tunic. 'Forgive the unexpected visit,' [target.GetFirstName] whispers, drawing close to you, 'but I dare not trust anyone else to answer such a sensitive request. I wanted to tell you, in person, that you can count on us when the time comes.'"
 me_argos_21_desc_failed:0 "You have received the reply from [target.GetName], a letter filled with insults and outright derision...and a threat! 'If you continue down this rebellious path, we shall make it known to the authorities that you are plotting - abandon your foolishness and remember your place.' Crumbling the parchment into a wad, you sneer and toss it to the ground. Remember [target.GetName] and add their family to the proscription list; when the time comes, you will not forget their cowardly lack of support."
 me_argos_21.a:0 "[target.GetName] will join us!"
 me_argos_21.b:0 "[target.GetName] has rejected to join!"
 
 me_argos_22_title:0 "A New Government"
 me_argos_22_desc:0 "All of the preparations are in place; you have trusted men in secured positions, your garrisoned troops throughout the realm are secretly armed, and your network of spies reports on the daily movements of your opponents. Somehow, the Gerousia has not picked up on what you are preparing to do; when you strike, you will have the element of surprise backing you. There is no turning away now! Forward to death or glory!"
 me_argos_22.a:0 "Time to fight!"
 
 me_argos_23_title:0 "A New Way Forward"
 me_argos_23_desc:0 "'Noble members of the Gerousia, I come before you today to speak out of necessity, for these trying times have forced my hands.' [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] casts [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] eyes across the gathered assembly; the entire room is silent, hanging upon every word.\n\n'What has worked for Argos in the past is clearly not helping us now. I, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], stand before you with a bold vision; I am here to propose a new way forward...'. \n\nA new character interaction, Gather Support, is now available."
 me_argos_23.a:0 "The time for action is upon us!"
 me_argos_23.b:0 "We will bide our time for now..."
 me_argos_23_tt:0 "The mission task '#Y $argos_missions_01_greece_task_18$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 
 me_argos_24_title:0 "Popular Support"
 me_argos_24_desc:0 "These last few weeks have been terribly nerve-racking, with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] convinced that the entire plot would be discovered, and yet these fears were never realized; somehow, the Gerousia remains blissfully unaware that their days of ruling are almost over. Perhaps this is a sign that the gods favor the plan?\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has somehow managed to gather enough support for a rebellion without alerting the authorities, and now,  only a few more preparations need to be made. The transition to monarchy will not be simple, but if attaining glory was a simple matter, then everyone would pursue it."
 me_argos_24.a:0 "The day of reckoning is almost upon us"
 me_argos_24_tt:0 "The mission task '#Y $argos_missions_01_greece_task_19$#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
