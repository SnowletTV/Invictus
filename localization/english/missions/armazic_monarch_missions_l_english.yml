 armazic_missions: "The Rise of the Iberian Kings"
 armazic_missions_DESCRIPTION: "If one sails from the great port cities of the Mediterranean, following the waterways past Byzantion until you reach the Pontus Euxinus, you will eventually reach a distant shore where a colossal mountain range, the Caucasus, rises to break up the vast northern steppe - this unforgiving land is our home. We have our own traditions here, worshiping the true gods that are unknown to outsiders, and although we are surrounded by enemies that would love to evict us from our highland cities, they have been unable to do so.\n\nNow, instead of giving our foes the chance to act upon their foul intentions, we must take our destiny firmly in hand."
 armazic_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the rulers of Iberia push back their neighbors, establishing a strong and secure nation that is able to project their power far from our mountain homeland."

 #Missions
 armazic_missions_task_1: "Surrounded by Enemies"
 armazic_missions_task_1_DESC: "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides; the grim Armenians to the south, arrogant Colchis to our west and the wild Albanians to the east. Because our military advisors cannot come to a consensus, we will fabricate claims on everyone around us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 armazic_missions_task_2: "The Push for the Coasts"
 armazic_missions_task_2_DESC: "Our recent victories come with the tantalizing promise of even greater rewards in the days ahead; if our soldiers continue to push onward, we will not only reach the shores of the Mare Hyrcanum, but we could even gain access to the waters of Pontus Euxinus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 armazic_missions_task_3: "Land of the Fleece"
 armazic_missions_task_3_DESC: "Even though we have shattered the might of [GetProvince('(int32)1715').GetArea.GetName], there are still fears that they could return to a position of strength. It has become clear that we must utterly eradicate them, in order to prevent this possibility from ever happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 armazic_missions_task_4: "Albanian Scraps"
 armazic_missions_task_4_DESC: "Our forces continue to destroy the Albanian tribesmen; now that we are firmly in control of their heartlands, it won't be long before we finish eating up the rest of the scraps of their kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
 armazic_missions_task_5: "Getting Our Feet Wet"
 armazic_missions_task_5_DESC: "Although we are new powerbrokers in the region, our presence in the Pontus Euxinus will soon be made known to all - our shipbuilding initiative will expand our influence far from the shores of our homeland! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 armazic_missions_task_6: "Empower the Eristavi"
 armazic_missions_task_6_DESC: "The Eristavi were a ennobled class of local rulers, with responsibilities similar to those of a governor, and were entrusted by the Pharnavazids with ruling over provinces in their name. Before we can enact any further reforms, we must grant them authority. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 armazic_missions_task_7: "A Unique Language"
 armazic_missions_task_7_DESC: "Although a large number of tongues are currently spoken in our homeland, with an equal number of written scripts being utilized by the people, we have decided that everyone must speak the same dialect and write in the same manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"
 armazic_missions_task_8: "Baiberdon"
 armazic_missions_task_8_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)1760').GetName], an important city in Armenia Superioris, is undefended, its walls being guarded by the reputation of the Armenian army alone. If we prepare our claims now and strike quickly, we believe that the entire province could fall to our soldiers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"
 armazic_missions_task_9: "From Lake Lychnitis"
 armazic_missions_task_9_DESC: "It is only a few day's ride to the capital of the Armenians from the newly-conquered city of [GetProvince('(int32)1572').GetName], and although they will resist our forces with everything they have, we must strike at the heart of their kingdom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 armazic_missions_task_10: "Armenian Fortifications"
 armazic_missions_task_10_DESC: "Because we have taken so many of the great cities of Armenia for ourselves, we are privy to vast stores of knowledge that we did not have access to before. Everyone knows that the Armenians build masterful fortifications, so why don't we teach our own engineers how to mimic their style? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 armazic_missions_task_11: "A Line of Kings"
 armazic_missions_task_11_DESC: "Because of the reforms ushered in by the Pharnavazid Dynasty, the glory of our people has been secured for generations. From our fortress at [GetProvince('(int32)1676').GetName] we reign over an expansive kingdom, one that we have put together with our own hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 armazic_missions_task_12: "Armazic Union"
 armazic_missions_task_12_DESC: "For the first time in the history of our people, the adherents of the Armazic Faith have been united under one crown, with the power of our neighboring enemies destroyed for a generation or more. May Armazi continue to pour his blessing upon us and lead us towards victory! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
 armazic_missions_task_13: "Iberian Wine"
 armazic_missions_task_13_DESC: "Our people are renowned for their skill at fermenting wine, a hobby which we have been pursuing for thousands of years. When the harvests have come in, we fill giant earthenware containers that we call 'kvevri' in our tongue and bury them deep into the ground. Those who drink Iberian wine can often find other vintages lacking in flavor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

Our military advisors cannot decide who is the weakest of our neighbors, adding to the confusion, so it has been decided that we should fabricate claims in all directions and wait for an opportune moment to expand."

Because they have lost core territories to our men, their forces are broken and in disarray, and our spies report morale in the enemy camps is at all-time low.

Having access to this body of water, with its opportunities for trade connections and perhaps even military expansion, is announcing to the world that Iberia is no bit player, but a force to be reckoned with."

Still, we salute the bravery of their fighters and regret the circumstances that forced us to slay our Caucasian brethren.\n\nNow that the final submission of the Albanian leaders has been received, it has been suggested that we create a feudatory state out of the remaining tribes.

Upon arriving at [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], the purpose of this meeting was soon made clear; desiring peace and stability above all else, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had decided to create a special type of governorship, a position known as an 'eristavi', that would act as an extension of the royal will. Calling forth seven men to stand before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim], [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] administered a sacred vow, handing out items to each of these leaders so that their authority would be acknowledged.

Realizing that this has become a predicament, especially when it comes to streamlining our bureacratic administration, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] commanded that everyone use a new script, one expressly created for the use of our people. It has also been stated that the manner of speaking embraced by the inhabitants of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is now the official vernacular, so everyone must adopt our particular accent."
