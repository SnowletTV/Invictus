 armenia_missions: "The Path to Power"
 armenia_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The Rise of the #E Kingdom of #COLOR:{0.83,0.53,0.3} Armenia#!#! can be characterized through the contact with other cultures, most notably the #E #COLOR:{0.50,0.60,1.00} Greek#!#! and #E #COLOR:{0.51,0.31,0.75} Persian#!#! ones, as well as the constant threat of invasion. Paired with its own rich history, the nascent kingdom of Armenia's future is fraught with danger and will necessitate a delicate touch and careful rule, for many hasty decisions have led realms into ruin and allowed for the rise of successor powers."
 armenia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete once we have secured our position and established ourselves as a great kingdom and solidified our identity."
