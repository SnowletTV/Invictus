 aryavarta_missions:0 "Land of the Aryans"
 aryavarta_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "#E Aryavarta#! means 'Land of the Aryans,' and refers primarily to #E Gandhara#! and #E Madhyadesa#!, collectively called the #E Indo-Gangetic Plain#!. The region #E Aryavarta#! covers has changed over time, but generally refers to the western Indo-Aryan people, referred to as the #E [GetCultureGroup('aryan').GetName]#! people."
 aryavarta_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when #E Aryavarta#! unites North India under its rule."
 aryavarta_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "The #E Aryans#! will rule India."
 
 #Missions
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_1:0 "Heart of Aryavarta"
 aryavarta_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Sheath all desires to conquer beyond the heartlands of the Aryans, for we must first unify the core territories. The rivers Satluj, Ravi, Beas, Jhelum, and Chenab, united by the river Sindhu, and the Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati. These are the rivers that give us our identity."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_2:0 "Consolidate the Sindhu"
 aryavarta_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "The Sindhu river, known to outsiders as the Indus, give the name of 'India' to this land we call home. We must consolodate all the lands of the Sindhu for our new Aryan state."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_3:0 "Consolidate the Ganga"
 aryavarta_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "The Ganga river, otherwise known as the Ganges, is the largest river system in all of Bharat and where the Aryan identity begins to morph. We must consolodate the Ganga for our new Aryan state."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_4:0 "The Indo-Gangetic Plain"
 aryavarta_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Indo-Gangetic Plain is a basic geographical description of the land of Aryavarta. It is where our people, the Aryans, thrive best. However, it is not where we shall rest. Aryavarta may have been realized, but there are Aryans beyond our borders yet. Thus, we have much more work to do."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_5:0 "Beyond the Seven Mountains"
 aryavarta_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "The seven mountains, or the Satpura, lay to our southern border seperating North Bharat from South Bharat. It's easy for us to draw our borders here, but the fact remains that Aryan civilization has expanded far beyond these seven mountains. And so, the fact remains we must follow our bretheren beyond these mighty cliffs."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_6:0 "The Maru Realm"
 aryavarta_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "Adjacent to the lower Sindhu, the region of Maru lies, blessed by its perfect coastline for trade to come and go. With a launching point in Sindh, we have all the means necessary to bring the rest of the Maru region into our control."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_7:0 "Aryans of Avanti"
 aryavarta_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Between the northwestern coast of Bharat and the Ganga river system in the east lay the once great Aryan kingdom of Avanti. While not always included in the definition of Aryavarta, they are both Aryan and would help our country feel connected through land instead of relying purely on the Sindhu and Gagnes."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_8:0 "The Magadha Realm"
 aryavarta_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "A cultural shift between Aryan groups occurred along the Madhyadesa region and it is largely because of the Magadhans of Pracya. Pracyian civilization might be our cousin group, however we need to make sure they turn back towards traditional Aryan culture. And what better way to do so than to conquer the homelands of the Mauryans themselves."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_9:0 "The Western Border"
 aryavarta_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "The Western Border, or Aparanta, is an impressively well irrigated area. The northern parts of the Western Ghat, it leads inwards into the rich spices of southern Bharat. The continuous Aryan civilization ends in Aparanta, and so it should be considered an integral new part of Aryavarta once it has come under our influence."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_10:0 "The Hunter Plateau"
 aryavarta_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Vindhyaprstha roughly translates to the Hunter Plateau, demonstrating what kinds of people inhabit these lands. Our eastern Pracyan cousins dominate it well and serve as a fierce foe to have. Thus, it will be easier to have them under our banners than as a seperate entity."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_11:0 "Sister in the South"
 aryavarta_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "There are many kingdoms south of the Satpura range, and many who share our Aryan heritage. It should not be so difficult to convince one of them to come under our rule through diplomacy rather than bloodshed."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_12:0 "New Kings in Kalinga"
 aryavarta_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The Kalingans are some of the most civilized of all the Pracyan peoples, and they could be more prosperous under our rule. While we could directly control them, they have demonstrated significant prowess at governing themselves, so perhaps nominal independence under our leadership is what fate has in store for them."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_13:0 "Lankans, Dravidians, Spices"
 aryavarta_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The southern tip of Bharat is known to us by three things: the furthest of all Aryans, the Lankans, the Dravidian peoples between us and Lanka, and the various spices @spices! blessed by Shiva himself."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_14:0 "The Resplendent Island"
 aryavarta_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "The thoroughly rich and colorful, or 'Sri,' island of the Lanka have developed their own history far from the core of the Aryan world. Perhaps they should be reintroduced to the mainstream Aryan sphere, or perhaps they should become vassals of our great lands. Regardless of what should happen, one thing is for certain: Sri Lanka should be under our rule."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_15:0 "The Garland of Islands"
 aryavarta_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "Described as a garland of islands, the Maldives have an interesting history. Coming from the Lankans, they represent a strange offshoot of Aryan culture that has somehow come both closer and further from the heartlands of Aryavarta. Regardless, they are our fellow bloodbrothers, and a united Aryan state needs them to be under our protection."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_16:0 "The Lofty Land"
 aryavarta_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "Karnata is known as the Lofty Land. It is well known to us Aryans, especially the rich parts of the Western Ghats whose monsoonal rains never cease to amaze outsiders. The plateau to the east of the Western Ghats meanwhile are dominated by the Dravidians. Both pieces of land comprise the Lofty Land, and thus the whole region shall come under our control."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_17:0 "The Water-Encircled Land"
 aryavarta_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Dravida is the Sanskrit word for a land surrounded on three sides by water. It also derives from the term 'Tamil,' which well describes which types of people occupy it. Apart from being surrounded by water, it is also surrounded on all sides by Indo-Aryan people, which naturally means that to complete an Aryan controlled Bharat, it must be finally settled by Aryans."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_18:0 "An Expedition to Burma"
 aryavarta_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "The region of Burma is filled with a foreign people who are no more related to us than the Dravidians to the south, however they differ in the fact that they adopt our traditions en masse, and are familiar with our culture. So let us take this marriage a step further, and formally introduce Burma into the Aryavarta sphere."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_19:0 "Masters of Bharat"
 aryavarta_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "When all lands of Bharat are controlled by Aryans, our mission will be complete. Bharat is our homeland, and it is united now. While foreign peoples live in its borders, the purest of the Vedic civilization that came to Bharat dominate it. Aryavarta and Bharatvarsha will come to be known as one and the same someday."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_20:0 "The Rann of Kaccha"
 aryavarta_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "The Kaccha area is known to be filled with a geographic feature known as a Rann. Rann translates to the salt marshes of Kaccha. In fact, although Kaccha is displayed on our maps as virtually an island, this is not true throughout the whole of the season. At times, the few inches of water that cover the salt marshes are shown to Lord Surya of the Sun. Regardless, we may use these Rann of Kaccha to harvest salt @salt! for ourselves."

 aryavarta_missions_task_21:0 "Aryan Agriculture"
 aryavarta_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "$me_aryavarta_21_desc$"
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_22:0 "Establish Trade Connections"
 aryavarta_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "We need to establish inter-continental trade within our land. We can do this by promoting and developing a series of trade cities across the Sindhu and Ganga rivers, resulting in ever-closer relations between the east and west Aryans within our borders."

 aryavarta_missions_task_23:0 "Culture of Color"
 aryavarta_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "The #E Vedic#! culture we embelish is an ever-colorful one. Reds, blues, purples, and more color our lifestyle. And we can do so because of our vast amounts of #Y Dyes#! @dye!, produced all throughout Aryavarta."

 aryavarta_missions_task_24:0 "The Indo-Gangetic Road"
 aryavarta_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "The #E Mauryans#! built roads connecting the Ganga river from #E Bengal#! to #E Panchanada#!, however, the Sindhu river has no such equivalent. Let's connect #E Sakala#!, which lay on the old #E Mauryan#! road system, to #E Debal#! at the end of the Sindhu."

 aryavarta_missions_task_25:0 "Temple of Kartikeya"
 aryavarta_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "The thousand headed god #E Kartikeya#! is certainly worthy for us to build a grand temple to. So let us honor him in #E Rohtok#! where his followers are plentiful, and show him that the #E Aryans#! are capable enough for his blessings."

 aryavarta_missions_task_26:0 "Temple of Shiva"
 aryavarta_missions_task_26_DESC:0 "#E Shiva#! the Destroyer, the Auspicious One, the Great God. The people of #E Varanasi#! already worship him well, so we shall honor #E Shiva#! furthermore by creating a great temple where his followers can come venerate the Blue-Throated One."

 aryavarta_missions_task_27:0 "Temple of Rama"
 aryavarta_missions_task_27_DESC:0 "The most relatable of gods, #E Rama#! will be given a brand new city to be worshipped in. A district in #E Nokhar#! have especially devout #E Rama#! worshippers. This distrcit will be called as #E Lavapur#!, after the name of the son of #E Rama#!, Prince Lava."

 aryavarta_missions_task_28:0 "Temple of Vishnu"
 aryavarta_missions_task_28_DESC:0 "#E Vishnu#! is one of the most popular of gods, and thus he will be given a great temple in the middle of one of the most prosperous and historically significant areas in #E Ayodhya#!. May his worship be everlasting!"

 aryavarta_missions_task_29:0 "Build a Grand Temple"
 aryavarta_missions_task_29_DESC:0 "If we set aside a vast sum and devote these resources towards building a Grand Temple to the gods, it could bring our country prosperity for years to come. We need only decide which of our great and holy Aryan cities is worthy for such a temple."
 
 aryavarta_missions_task_30:0 "Rekindle Vedicism"
 aryavarta_missions_task_30_DESC:0 "As the former Kingdom of Porus, #E Paurava#!, we were once presented with many choices on which faith to embrace. Now, being the Raja of all Aryans, we need to make concessions to the #E Vedics#! of our lands. If we are already #E Vedic#! ourselves, this will only be a boon! Yet if not, we may need to consider compromises."

 aryavarta_missions_task_32:0 "Dravidian Dreams"
 aryavarta_missions_task_32_DESC:0 "The Dravidians who we now rule over are an interesting bunch. Their #E Agamic#! faith is similar to our #E Vedic#! traditions, yet so very dissimilar at the same time. They are not #E Indo-Aryan#! at all, and perhaps it should stay that way. Or perhaps we should remove any hope of their independence right now."
