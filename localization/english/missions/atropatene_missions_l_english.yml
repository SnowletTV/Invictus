 atropatene_mission_01_BUTTON_DETAILS:0 "Rise of the Medes"
 atropatene_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The reputation of the Median people is known everywhere; our soothsayers and dream-interpreters, the most knowledgeable in the world, are sought after in all of the capitals of the great Empires. Our magnificent ruler Atropates I Atropatid once ruled as a satrap to both the Persians and the Macedonians, but the death of Alexander and the Wars of the Diadochi have given our people a taste of freedom for the first time in many generations. While many hope to subjugate our realm like so many others have before, our people, guided by the Zoroastrian Faith that sustains us, will not quietly submit to foreign authority. No - we have other plans."
 atropatene_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Medes have restored the borders of the famed Cyaraxes, our third king that led our forces to eternal glory."

 me_atropatene_50_title:0 "The Fate of Persia"
 me_atropatene_50_desc:0 "The archives seem almost endless, filled to the brim with scrolls and tablets from the Achaemenids and even the more recent Seleukid occupiers. Hopefully Alexander and Seleucus did not destroy or relocate too much of the records. In truth, it could take years to completely analyze all these texts. Until we have better secured and purged the libraries of all previous Achaemenid and Greek employees, our actions can never be completely secret. How should we go about looking for Cyrus' secrets?"
 me_atropatene_50.a:0 "Let the Persians have autonomy again, but make sure they maintain Median ties."
 me_atropatene_50.b:0 "We must keep the Persians close, lest they rise up again."
 me_atropatene_50.c:0 "There can be no forgiveness - let Persis burn!"
