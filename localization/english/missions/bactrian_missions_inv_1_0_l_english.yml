 bactrian_mission_01_bactria:0 "The Bactrian Heartland"
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_DESCRIPTION:0 "Our satrapy remains under the iron grip of the Seleukid Empire, which has become pre-occupied with numerous conflicts to the West. As the Seleukids attempt to lay claim to the lands of Syria and Anatolia, they have left us to languish, unable to defend our lands from the barbarian hordes of Scythia. Bactria is wealthy, urbanized and fertile, and could become a great nation in its own right, however this can only be done by freeing ourselves from the grip of the Seleukid Empire once and for all. We will then build our nation into a thriving empire, centered on our Bactrian heartland."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete after we have freed ourselves from Seleukid control and build up Bactria as an economic and agricultural center."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Our Bactrian heartland is fed by the Oxus and Jaxartes rivers, allowing us to grow ample food. Our cities are large and prosperous, and our key trade routes have opened us up to the wealth of India and Serica. We must invest heavily in our heartland, and in turn transform it into one of the most powerful Hellenistic states."

 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_1_DESC:0 "In order for Bactria to truly achieve greatness, we must free ourselves from the grip of the Seleukid Empire. Their pre-occupation with conflicts in the West has left them unable to defend or support our lands. Independence is our only option."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_2_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6678').GetName] is the capital and cultural heart of Bactria, from which the region takes its name. We have established this city as our national capital, however it remains distinctly Persian. Rebuilding and Hellenizing [GetProvince('(int32)6678').GetName] will turn it into a true seat of power for our fledgling empire."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_3_DESC:0 "Bactria is heavily urbanized compared to other regions of Persia, which in turn has made us quite wealthy. Establishing new cities in our capital region will bolster our trade, wealth and population growth."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_4_DESC:0 "Despite the upper classes of Bactria being made up mostly of Greek Macedonians, we still feel as if we are aliens in this land. Rather than impose our Greek culture upon the Persian citizens of Bactria, we should forge a new Greco-Bactrian culture that preserves the best elements of both peoples."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_5_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6688').GetName] is a major Hellenistic city in Bactria, founded by Alexander himself. The population of this city is mostly Greek, and they have requested the construction of new temples and theatres. We should invest in this city and turn it into a thriving cultural center."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_6_DESC:0 "We are beset by enemies on our southern and eastern frontiers. The Seleukids will no doubt attempt to reclaim their lost Bactrian lands, and the rising power in the East, the Maurya Empire, also looks upon our kingdom with great interest. We must fortify our borders to prevent enemy incursion."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_7_DESC:0 "The ancient city of [GetProvince('(int32)6686').GetName] was re-founded by Alexander the Great, however it has been decided to bestow a new name upon the city. We will also embellish it so that it more closely resembles a Hellenistic settlement."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_8_DESC:0 "The Oxus valley is the breadbasket of our kingdom, producing large amounts of food for our people. Expanding the agricultural potential of this region will make us self-sufficient and less reliant on hostile neighbors for food."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_9_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6682').GetName] is a wealthy commercial trading center and has a strategic location on the Silk Road, which connects our empire to Serica. Constructing new market places and trade depots will expand our trade in the region and bring more wealth to Bactria."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_10_DESC:0 "The Sogdian rocks of [GetProvince('(int32)6719').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)6700').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)6701').GetName] are important fortresses that have fallen into disrepair since Alexander's conquests. Rebuilding these fortresses will make enemy incursion into Sogdiana much more difficult."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_11_DESC:0 "Sogdiana is wealthy and holds many large and important cities. It has the potential to be the commercial heart of our kingdom, and requires substantial investment on our end."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_12_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName] was founded by the great Persian king Cyrus the Great, and was a testament to the might and extent of the Achaemenid Empire. Unfortunately, this city has fallen into dereliction due to mass migration to the nearby city of [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName]. We should restore [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName] to its former glory."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_13_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName] represents the furthest extent of the Hellenistic world. No other Greek city has been built beyond this point. Of course, this is subject to change. Building up [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName] will allow us to use it as a base of operations for further expansion into Scythia. The wayward tribes north of the Ferghana valley may eventually become our future subjects."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_14_DESC:0 "Settling a new Hellenistic settlement in the Fergana Valley will help establish our hold over this fertile region. The Massagetian peoples have become unruly as of late, and a strong Greek presence there could help with integration."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_15_DESC:0 "The Fergana Valley is another important agricultural region in our kingdom, and is fed by the Jaxartes river. It feeds all of Sogdiana, and must be developed to support an ever growing population."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_16_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6668').GetName] is the capital of Margiana and another large Hellenistic settlement that falls under our control. Reinforcing and expanding [GetProvince('(int32)6668').GetName]'s infrastructure will turn it into a truly magnificent Greco-Bactrian settlement."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_17_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6668').GetArea.GetName] is the third province of our empire, alongside Bactriana and Sogdiana. It is vulnerable to the Parthian hordes, as well as the Seleukids below, and has great agricultural and commercial potential. It should not be ignored."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_18_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6668').GetArea.GetName] remains mostly depopulated and unsettled outside of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)6668').GetName]. We should establish a new urban center at [GetProvince('(int32)6665').GetName] and make it the second city of Margiana."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_19_DESC:0 "To the north of our kingdom lie the fertile regions of [GetProvince('(int32)6708').GetArea.GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)6803').GetArea.GetName]. Alexander was never able to conquer these lands, saving the glory for us instead. Taking control of the Chorasmian Oasis will provide us with another rich agricultural region that is ripe for settlement."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_20_DESC:0 "Chorasmia is ours, however the region remains highly agrarian and undeveloped. We must settle cities in this region and civilize the barbarian tribes that occupy it."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_21_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6803').GetName] was the tribal capital of the Chorasmians. We must rebuild it as a proud Greco-Bactrian city."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_22_DESC:0 "The fertile oasis of Chorasmia is fed by the Oxian Sea to the north, and has immense agricultural potential. Developing this region will ensure that we will never want for food again."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_23_DESC:0 "A promising new figure has arrived in the Bactrian court from the Seleukid Empire. His charisma and military expertise have already won many over to his side and he has grown a sizeable following in our capital. There are rumors that he may be just the man we need to lead Bactria to greater glory."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_24_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6678').GetName] has served as our capital for many years, but its location is less than ideal. Founding a new capital at [GetProvince('(int32)6694').GetName] would give us direct access to the Oxus river and centralize our rule in the most prosperous and urbanized region of Bactria."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_25_DESC:0 "We have adopted many Persian and Greek military traditions, which has given our soldiers a great advantage. We must reform our military to match the might of our more powerful neighbors if we would like our independence to last."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_26_DESC:0 "Bactria remains isolated from the rest of the Hellenistic world. We should appeal to settlers from the lands of Greece, Macedonia and Asia to immigrate to Bactria so that we can maintain strong ties with our motherland."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_27_DESC:0 "Beyond the Emodian mountains lies the mysterious land of Serica. It is said to contain empires and wealth greater than anything we can possibly imagine. We should expand our holdings in this region to gain access to more lucrative trade with Serica."
 bactrian_mission_01_bactria_task_final_DESC:0 "Bactria has emerged from its independence as a wealthy and powerful kingdom in its own right. Our commercial and agricultural potential is immense, and the future of our people looks bright. With our heartland fully developed, we should look beyond our borders for possible expansion."
