 # Tasks

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_1_DESC:0 "The infighting amongst our Tribal Chieftains is damaging our true potential by causing unnecessary division. Not only are we separated by petty rivalries, but the geography of our territory, with its rollicking hills, dense forest and imposing mountains, also divides our people; all impediments to establishing our centralized command. If we increase the absolute authority of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], it will only benefit us moving forward."
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_2:0 "New Coinage Standard" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_2_DESC:0 "One of that many things that differentiates us from other Celtic tribes is our usage of gold coins, which we proudly mint in our own territories. We should consider standardizing our currency; stamping the likenesses of our chieftains on our coins, in the manner of the great Kings, would certainly increase our standing at home and abroad."
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_3:0 "Akropolis of Baemia" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_3_DESC:0 "The primeval forests of Baemia, situated close to our capital and holy to our people, are an ideal location for a new city; we should consider investing in construction when we can afford it.

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_10_DESC:0 "The fierce Germanic tribes to our north, while no match for the Boii when it comes to arms or feats of bravery, are certainly a threat that we should not ignore.

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_11:0 "Lugian League" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_11_DESC:0 "We should consider sending overtures to the Vandals, suggesting that we form a mutually-beneficial League - headed by us, of course.

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_12:0 "Amber Coast" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_12_DESC:0 "Amber is a highly-desired trade good in the cities of the south, used to make jewelry and other dazzling trinkets. We would make a pretty penny if we stopped being middlemen for Pharodenia and Rugia and controlled the resources outright."

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_13_DESC:0 "The numerous tribes of Pannonia have finally laid down their weapons, realizing the futility in challenging the might of the Boii. Resting secure in our victory, we cast our eyes upon the lands of the war-loving Dacians."

 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_15:0 "Boihaemian Commonwealth" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_15_DESC:0 "When we set out on the ambitious road before us, we had no idea of the vast strides our people would make as a whole. No one can claim that we are mere hill-dwellers, eking out a shabby existence on the slopes of wind-blasted mountains. We are the establishers of a Boihaemian Commonwealth, and it is upon this firm foundation that our majestic future shall be built."
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_16:0 "Ferrum Noricum" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_16_DESC:0 "We should consider seizing the mountain passes of Noreia for two reasons. Not only would we have unfettered passage through the Alpes Carniae, allowing us to spill south of the mountains every spring, but we would also have access to the iron ore found in the rocky hills."
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_17:0 "Salt of Laciacum" 
 barbaricum_bohemia_mission_task_17_DESC:0 "Salt is a precious commodity, used to season and store foodstuffs, and it appears that the Boii have grown a taste for it. We should move into Laciacum; the small lakes in the region, while not the best for drinking, could produce enough salt for our meager needs."
