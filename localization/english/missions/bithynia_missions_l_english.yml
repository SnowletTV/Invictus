bithynia_missions:0 "Kingdom of Zipoetes"
bithynia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The small kingdom ruled by Zipoetes, nestled on the northern shores of Bithynia et Paphlagonia, is not large enough to contain the ambitions of our mighty dynasty. As chaos swirls around the wider world, with kings and generals rising and falling with each passing day, Zipoetes vows that his name shall be remembered forevermore."
bithynia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Kingdom of Zipoetes realizes its true potential by extending its dominions far and wide..."
bithynia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "A long and ambitious path stands before us, but we eagerly take the first steps towards eternal glory."

bithynia_missions_task_1:0 "A Proper Capital"
bithynia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Our province of Mariandynia is an important part of our kingdom, yet its provincial capital is an embarrassment - hardly a settlement worth mentioning. Our people deserve a proper city, a proper capital. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

bithynia_missions_task_2:0 "The City of Zipoetes"
bithynia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Artanes, the seat of government, has been growing at a seemingly exponential pace; an attestation to the dynamic leadership of Zipoetes. Because we owe so much to our King, we are considering renaming the city in his honor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

bithynia_missions_task_3:0 "Last of the Achaemenids"
bithynia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Although the political power of the Achaemenids has been shattered, the blood of Achaemenes still flows. By joining Houses, it would only bolster our own standing - let us seek a suitable marriage for our heir. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

bithynia_missions_task_4:0 "Kings of Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The rich cities that line the coast of the Sea Propontis are dominated by petty tyrants and pirates; unworthy squatters on what we consider to be our land. Let us make our claims formally known and begin the process of evicting these pretenders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

bithynia_missions_task_5:0 "Developing Food Stores"
bithynia_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "The explosive growth in our cities has resulted in the need to expand our infrastructure; we simply need more food. Let us develop our pasturage so we avoid hungry mobs in our streets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

bithynia_missions_task_6:0 "Consolidating Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "Chalcedon and Astakos, hiding behind the guarantee of the powerful Antigonids, have been acting with impunity as of late. Alas, their lands would be such wonderful possessions to have, but we dare not risk war with the Antigonid Kingdom. Might there be another way that we could prevent hostilities? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

bithynia_missions_task_7:0 "Friends in Mariandynia "
bithynia_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "While we are the masters of the coasts of Mariandynia, the hills and mountains are outside of our control, for now. If we ally our neighbors and improve their opinion of us, there is a chance they will submit to us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"

bithynia_missions_task_8:0 "War with Mariandynia "
bithynia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "There is no reason that we should tolerate an independent Mariandynia, when we already control so much of the lands of the province. Extend our dominion and end their pretensions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"

bithynia_missions_task_9:0 "Beyond Mariandynia "
bithynia_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "While we have some ancient cultural connections to the Mariandynians, we are two separate peoples forced to live in the same house. By integrating or assimilating them into our society, it will quell any potential for friction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_10:0 "Expanding the Kingdom"
bithynia_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "It is only fitting that the kingdom of Bithynia rules over any province that claims the same name. Bithynia Inferioris should become a homeland for all Bithynians, not just the barbarians that live outside of our borders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"

bithynia_missions_task_11:0 "Kingdom of Zipoetes"
bithynia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "No one can deny that we are a powerful kingdom, but we are not satisfied with what we have, when there is so much that is left for the taking. Prepare our claims and let the dice fall where they may. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

bithynia_missions_task_12:0 "Cities of Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "Our reputation as city builders is predicated upon our vast experience, honed by years of successful building programs. As a result of our architectural expertise, a Bithynian City is like no other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

bithynia_missions_task_13:0 "Spreading Bithynian Ways"
bithynia_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "Kalpe holds a special place in your heart, and the considerable investments you have poured into the city has always been a labor of love. And yet there is more we could do for our pet project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

bithynia_missions_task_14:0 "Expanding the Navy"
bithynia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "While there are many great seafaring powers around us that we must contend with, we are up for the challenge. Order that trees be felled and construction in our shipyards commence immediately. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

bithynia_missions_task_15:0 "Heading East"
bithynia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "While we are not necessarily greedy, we are not necessarily satisfied with what we have, either. Now that Mariandynia is undisputedly under our control, we have new options to expand eastward - we should do so. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

bithynia_missions_task_16:0 "Masters of Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "If we consolidate control over the entirety of Bithynia et Paphlagonia, our deserving leader will be honored by the people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"

bithynia_missions_task_17:0 "A Bithynian Legion"
bithynia_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Our levies have carried us to countless victories, but by expanding our legion, we will have a professional fighting force that will augment our already impressive military might. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"

bithynia_missions_task_18:0 "Ports of Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "By increasing the number of ports that we have under our control, our financial security will be all but assured. We shall be the envy of our neighbors, especially as they watch their coins entering our coffers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

bithynia_missions_task_19:0 "New Markets"
bithynia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Our markets cannot currently keep up with the demand for trade that we are experiencing. It is in our best interest to accommodate these traders and merchants with marketplaces, to ensure that they continue to ply their wares in our cities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

bithynia_missions_task_20:0 "The Land of the Thracians"
bithynia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "Having secured our position in Asia, we have boldly established our foothold on the shores of Europe. The time will soon come where the inhabitants of Thrace will acknowledge their new masters across the sea; the Bithynians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

bithynia_missions_task_21:0 "Into Asia"
bithynia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "So far, we have focused our expansion on the rich coast cities that surround us, thanks in large part to our incredible naval power. But there is no good reason for us to limit ourselves to the waterways; the lands of Asia are worthy of conquering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

bithynia_missions_task_22:0 "Reconquering our Homeland"
bithynia_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "In days long forgotten, it was a group of Thracian colonists that first came to Bithynia, seeking freedom from tyranny - let us now bring liberty to our ancient homelands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_23:0 "Protector of Thracians"
bithynia_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "After our wars of foreign conquest, it seems that we are the lords of the entirety of the Thracian peoples. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_24:0 "Phrygian Power"
bithynia_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "The province of Phyrgia would be an attractive addition to your domain; besides, so many have squabbled over this land recently that no one can truly claim it as their own, as there are no true legitimate rulers here - why shouldn't the Bithynians have it, then? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

bithynia_missions_task_25:0 "Conquering Cappadocia"
bithynia_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "There is much that we can tolerate, but we cannot abide the existence of a Cappadocian threat another moment, another day. It would be better for all parties involved if we just extended our borders a bit more in that direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"

bithynia_missions_task_26:0 "Crossing the Sea"
bithynia_missions_task_26_DESC:0 "Our navy is well-funded and masters of the sea, but there is still room for us to grow; by continuing to invest our funds wisely and by creating a massive fleet, we will be truly dominate the waters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

bithynia_missions_task_27:0 "Turbulence in Taurica"
bithynia_missions_task_27_DESC:0 "As we consider the entirety of the Pontus Euxinus to be well within our sphere of influence, disturbances abroad often cause damaging repercussions at home - it is best to sometimes nip these potential problems in the bud, as they say. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil5!"

bithynia_missions_task_28:0 "Controlling the Coast"
bithynia_missions_task_28_DESC:0 "Being the masters of the unimaginable potential of the coast of Asia is a reward in and of itself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"

bithynia_missions_task_29:0 "An Aegean Power"
bithynia_missions_task_29_DESC:0 "The steady flow of traffic throughout the Aegean would be better managed by a specialized bureaucracy, one that manages the daily affairs while reporting to us directly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil22!"

bithynia_missions_task_30:0 "Masters of the Peloponnese"
bithynia_missions_task_30_DESC:0 "After everything that we have done for the inhabitants of the Peloponnese, can anyone deny that we are its true Masters? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil23!"

bithynia_missions_task_31:0 "Protectors of Greece"
bithynia_missions_task_31_DESC:0 "The realities of the political situation in Greece require us to protect the weaker from the machinations of those around her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_32:0 "Dominate Phrygia"
bithynia_missions_task_32_DESC:0 "Possessing the extensive road networks of the province of Phrygia has become a matter of dire interest; we want a cut of the trade that is carried along these highways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil15!"

bithynia_missions_task_33:0 "The Southern Coast"
bithynia_missions_task_33_DESC:0 "The fractured state of the southern coast of Anatolia provides us with opportunities to subdue and expand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

bithynia_missions_task_34:0 "Destroy the Mithridatic Dynasty"
bithynia_missions_task_34_DESC:0 "The thought of the hated Mithridatic dynasty being in a position of power...no, we shall not allow it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil8!"

bithynia_missions_task_35:0 "Kings of Cappadocia"
bithynia_missions_task_35_DESC:0 "Press on further, o Bithynia, to the lands of the Cappadocians and to the doorway of Armenia itself - let all flee before us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

bithynia_missions_task_36:0 "Thracian Taurica"
bithynia_missions_task_36_DESC:0 "There is much that we could learn from the disparate peoples of Taurica, lessons that we could apply throughout our realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil11!"

bithynia_missions_task_37:0 "Kings of Asia"
bithynia_missions_task_37_DESC:0 "Asia is ours; the Bithynians are now its Kings and Lords. We have brought unification to a contentious land and it has become a bastion of our security; we now contend with the greatest civilizations the world has ever seen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

bithynia_missions_task_38:0 "Kings of Greece"
bithynia_missions_task_38_DESC:0 "We are, at long last, the Kings of Greece, and our name will be spoken forevermore - eternal glory is already ours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

bithynia_missions_task_39:0 "Syrian Ambition"
bithynia_missions_task_39_DESC:0 "We will press south, into the lands of Syria, for no one can stop us from doing whatever it is that want. Might makes right, and we are the strongest! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic3!"

bithynia_missions_task_40:0 "Conquest of Syria"
bithynia_missions_task_40_DESC:0 "Our holdings extend far beyond the original borders of the coasts of the Pontus Euxinus, including the faraway lands of Syria and Assyria. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

bithynia_missions_task_41:0 "Levantine Aspirations"
bithynia_missions_task_41_DESC:0 "We are now in control of an important strategic region of the Levant, which has eased the minds of your generals - our people's security is within our grasp. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_42:0 "The Land of Pharaohs"
bithynia_missions_task_42_DESC:0 "The Land of the Pharaohs belongs to those who can claim her, as shown by the crimes of the Achaemenids and the Ptolemies. We can practically see the pyramids from our current vantage point, and soon, they will be ours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil12!"

bithynia_missions_task_43:0 "A New Dynasty"
bithynia_missions_task_43_DESC:0 "Although some might call us insane, filled with delusions of grandeur that aren't befitting of a Bithynian Basileus, we can claim, by right, a new title, one that properly describes what we have become. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_por1!"

bithynia_missions_task_44:0 "Mesopotamian Matters"
bithynia_missions_task_44_DESC:0 "The mysterious city of Babylon beckons us; let us harness this source of ancient strength and wisdom for ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

bithynia_missions_task_45:0 "Take the Boot"
bithynia_missions_task_45_DESC:0 "Our first foray across the waters of the Fretum Hydruntis will certainly not be our last. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil10!"

bithynia_missions_task_46:0 "Fight for the South"
bithynia_missions_task_46_DESC:0 "As the Kings of Greece, we consider the lands of Magna Graecia to be under our purview as well and will expel any trespassers on our property. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"

bithynia_missions_task_47:0 "The Fall of Rome"
bithynia_missions_task_47_DESC:0 "Conquering the fearsome Romans, with their love of warfare, will bring tranquility and stability to our markets; we simply can't afford for these barbarians to disrupt our trade anymore. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

bithynia_missions_task_48:0 "Dominate Italia"
bithynia_missions_task_48_DESC:0 "We have somehow managed to expand into territories far beyond our original borders, stopping at the foothills of mountain ranges that we never knew existed before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil9!"

bithynia_missions_task_49:0 "Illyrian Raid"
bithynia_missions_task_49_DESC:0 "We have grown tired of the pesky Illyrian tribes that use the Haemus Mountains as a shield, raiding our lands with relative impunity before running like cowards back into the craggy hills. We should humble these barbarians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

bithynia_missions_task_50:0 "Kings of Illyria"
bithynia_missions_task_50_DESC:0 "Prudence dictates that we claim the entirety of Illyria, for there is much that we can do for these peoples if they only acknowledge us as their King. Better us than anyone else. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil4!"

bithynia_missions_task_51:0 "Bithynian Dominance"
bithynia_missions_task_51_DESC:0 "We have embraced our roles as Protector and Master, and our people rejoice in our divine leadership and all of the fruits of our labors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_por2!"

bithynia_missions_task_52:0 "Bithynian Influence"
bithynia_missions_task_52_DESC:0 "Is it any wonder that so many wish to be like the Bithynians? How could you visit our cities and not desire to be as great as we are? We welcome all that wish to adopt our ways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

bithynia_missions_task_53:0 "A Thriving Capital"
bithynia_missions_task_53_DESC:0 "Zipoetium is becoming one of the largest cities in the region, if you can even call it a city anymore. Before long, the city of Zipoetes will soon be known as the metropolis of Zipoetes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

bithynia_missions_task_54:0 "Investments in Asia"
bithynia_missions_task_54_DESC:0 "When the vast potential of the lands of Asia are considered, it is a travesty that previous rulers did not fully develop the region. Bring Bithynian marketplaces to these hungry provinces and watch the incomes grow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"

bithynia_missions_task_55:0 "Coastal Ventures"
bithynia_missions_task_55_DESC:0 "Our extensive network of port cities, the economic and cultural backbone of our society, requires us to have the strongest navy; no one should be able to challenge us at sea. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil3!"

bithynia_missions_task_56:0 "Increase Food Production"
bithynia_missions_task_56_DESC:0 "Our lands are good and desirable, but the sheer amount of inhabitants in our cities makes feeding them an onerous task. If we increase our food production at home, then we won't have to import as much grain from abroad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

bithynia_missions_task_57:0 "The Bithynian People"

bithynia_missions_task_58:0 "Cappadocian Construction"
bithynia_missions_task_58_DESC:0 "The lands of Cappadocia grow like weeds watered by daily showers; great metropoles emerge in its mountains and hills. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

bithynia_missions_task_59:0 "The City of Byzantion"
bithynia_missions_task_59_DESC:0 "Byzantion, the ancient city built by Byzas of Megara, lies directly to our west and was once a fierce competitor of ours, but we have eclipsed their glories with our own. Still, there is an undeniable potential in this city, and we predict great things for this city on the Bosporus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic1!"

bithynia_missions_task_60:0 "Developing Thrace"
bithynia_missions_task_60_DESC:0 "We ought to devote some attention to our holdings in Thrace; it is our sacred duty to our ancestors, after all. Let us increase the production of trade goods as best as we can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic8!"

bithynia_missions_task_61:0 "Aegean Markets"
bithynia_missions_task_61_DESC:0 "Our Aegean islands are perfect candidates for further developing economically; we should stop talking about this and make it a reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_por1!"

bithynia_missions_task_62:0 "Greek Cooperation"
bithynia_missions_task_62_DESC:0 "Wine and olives are a cornerstone of the Bithynian diet, with the many varieties found throughout Greece proving to be exceptionally popular with our people. We can never have enough of these two things, to be honest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

bithynia_missions_task_63:0 "Cities of Bithynia"
bithynia_missions_task_63_DESC:0 "At this point, we have refined the establishment of Bithynian Cities from a science into an art, and we are virtuosos of our craft. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

bithynia_missions_task_64:0 "Bithynian Greatness"
bithynia_missions_task_64_DESC:0 "The favorable locations of our port cities and other various holdings throughout Bithynia et Paghlagonia, concentrated as they are, are the economic engines of prosperity that lift our nation above all others. Developing these possessions further will make us the wealthiest land in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

bithynia_missions_task_65:0 "Macedonian Money"
bithynia_missions_task_65_DESC:0 "Macedon is a good location for the building and maintenance of cities; we have excellent possessions at our disposal already, but there is room for us to grow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

bithynia_missions_task_66:0 "Bithynian Commanders"
bithynia_missions_task_66_DESC:0 "Only the finest military minds should command our soldiers. Let us find a suitable leader to inspire our men to greater and greater victories. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

bithynia_missions_task_67:0 "Ensuring Control"
bithynia_missions_task_67_DESC:0 "We have subdued the lands around us, a gargantuan task worthy of Herakles himself, but security is an ever-elusive thing. Let us ensure our control of our homelands by erecting fortifications to protect us from our many rivals for power. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

bithynia_missions_task_68:0 "A New Title"
bithynia_missions_task_68_DESC:0 "Our distinguished legion would be better served by having a dedicated Commander, one that we can trust to lead our armies to glory. We shall establish this rank immediately. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

bithynia_missions_task_69:0 "Victorious Legions"
bithynia_missions_task_69_DESC:0 "The Commander of Bithynia should be no theorist, hiding behind military texts and guided by aphorism, but should have first-hand knowledge of the battlefield. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"

bithynia_missions_task_70:0 "Hellenic Asia"
bithynia_missions_task_70_DESC:0 "Religious concord is to be desired for our people; we do not have the patience for petty local rivalries to turn into anything serious. We should encourage that the proper religious rites are followed and hope that our example is emulated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic13!"

me_bithynia_1_title:0 "The City of Kalpe"
me_bithynia_1_desc:0 "After months of steady construction, our chief architect reports that Kalpe, once a ramshackle settlement of huts and thatched hovels on the coast of Pontus Euxinus, is now a true city. Word has spread quickly about our great accomplishment, and we are already seeing an influx of citizens arriving throughout all Bithynia. Many are hoping to find their fortunes in Mariandynia's new capital, and every day, more and more ships arrive in your bustling ports. We were wise to fund the construction, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."

me_bithynia_2_title:0 "Zipoetium"
me_bithynia_2_desc:0 "Artanes has grown so much over the last few years that the old city is hardly recognizable; even the historic district, the small fish market that was built outside the citadel's walls, has been transformed into something very different. Because the Artanes of old has been subsumed by your building initiative, it has been proposed that the city be renamed Zipoetium, an honor that you humbly accept. \n\nOne afternoon, as the setting sun paints the waters of the Pontus Euxinus in dazzling hues of orange and red, you decide to take a walk down the main avenues, reveling in the sounds of your city settling down into the evening. There are only faint cries in the markets now; a lone shopkeeper tenaciously looking to make a couple more coins before night falls. As you cast your gaze into the harbor, eyes filled with the sight of dozens of sleepy ships swaying in the gentle waters, your heart swells at the beauty of it all."

The day of the wedding is here, and you couldn't have chosen a better bride for your son; you have actually had the pleasure of meeting her once before, and she is an absolutely charming girl, devilishly smart and quite beautiful - an opinion that is thankfully shared by your son. She will be a lovely addition to the family."
