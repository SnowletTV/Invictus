 #Missions
 
 blemmia_missions_task_1: "Adabulian Obligations"
 blemmia_missions_task_1_DESC: "Commonly considered a sub-tribe of the greater Blemmyan group, the Adabulians must be approached regarding their integration into our federated system of semi-nomadic peoples."
 blemmia_missions_task_1_tt: "All characters holding an #E office#! must have #E loyalty#! greater than #Y 65#!."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_2: "Political Stratification"
 blemmia_missions_task_2_DESC: "To best rule such a vast realm, the older and wealthier Blemmyan families have chosen to implement a tripartite system, splitting the hierarchy of governance into tribal chiefs, clan lords, and the great chief."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_3: "Mons Smaragdus"
 blemmia_missions_task_3_DESC: "The olivine emerald mines of Mons Smaragdus, famed since the times of the oldest pharaohs, must one again by exploited by the peoples of the desert - it is a Blemmyan natural resource."
 blemmia_missions_task_3_tt: "#Y Blemmia#! has enacted the #Y Cultural Decision#! called #Y Land Ownership Protection#! for the #Y Blemmyan#! culture."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_4: "Blemmyan Gold"
 blemmia_missions_task_4_DESC: "To fuel the growing Blemmyan federation and ensure its sovereignty against the likes of the Ptolemies and the royals of Kush, economic growth through gold mining must be achieved."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_5: "Recall the Medjay"
 blemmia_missions_task_5_DESC: "Many Egyptian nobles and cities use Blemmyans as policemen, harkening back to the old days when many of our kind were known as the Medjay. These warriors should be protecting our villages and our people!"
 
 blemmia_missions_task_6: "Ties with the Megabaroi"
 blemmia_missions_task_6_DESC: "Often considered a cousin of the Blemmyans, the Megabaroi have learned to cultivate and prosper along the Nubian banks of the Nile. They must be reminded of their ties with our tribes."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_7: "Segmented Rule"
 blemmia_missions_task_7_DESC: "The Blemmyans are a mobile people and, to control a vast amount of land, the rulers must have many politically stable checkpoints to travel between, the same as pastoralists migrating to follow the patterns of the rain."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_8: "The All-Golden City"
 blemmia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Berenike Panchrysos stands as a testament to the Blemmyan people, power, and political stability. Use its golden reserves to fulfill its namesake and construct a haven within the desert."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_9: "The Emerald Trade"
 blemmia_missions_task_9_DESC: "With the olivine mines up and running, the Blemmyans must make the best use of this boon to establish rich trade routes and enrichen our barren lands."
 blemmia_missions_task_9_tt: "#Y Blemmia#! will #E colonize#! the province of #Y Ichthyophagia#! and connect its trade land route to the port of #Y Adouli#!."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_10: "Red Land Networks"
 blemmia_missions_task_10_DESC: "To the east of the Nile, few peoples can confidently travel the dunes, the barren straits, and the empty fields of the Red Land which lies between river and sea. Using camels, well-bred horses, and the tricks of nomads, the Blemmyans shall turn these empty wastes into highways of trade and cultural influence."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_11: "Tabot Workshops"
 blemmia_missions_task_11_DESC: "On the lands of the Adabuli, the site of Tabot sits idle as a perfect spot for manufacturing great luxury goods for export with the many gem mines in the nearby hills. The people should take to the lands and turn this desolate spot into an emporium."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_12: "Headless Men"
 blemmia_missions_task_12_DESC: "Those from far off lands know nothing of the true Blemmyan people and have come to confuse the desert-dwellers with monstrous, headless men who wear faces on their chests. Let the tribes exploit this misconception to bring fear to our enemies and obscure the land's true beauty."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_13: "The Trogodytes"
 blemmia_missions_task_13_DESC: "A tribe among the Blemmyans, the Trogodytes are another confused people. Due to the complexity of their language and their isolated behavior, they have been diminished to simple cave-dwellers in the eyes of foreigners. Let their true potential and combat techniques be used to inspire awe in the Egyptians and Kushites."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_14: "Raiding Dodekaschoinos"
 blemmia_missions_task_14_DESC: "The twenty cities along the middle-stretch of the Nile, leading to the island of Philae, have always stood out as prosperous and worthy for cattle, grain, slaves, and riches. Blemmyan spies have reported value in the siezing the so-called Final Island itself for the richness of its temple complex."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_15: "The Blemmyan Kingdom"
 blemmia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "No longer a simple pastoral people, the Blemmyan realm has chosen a royal family to lead the people forward as a great king of all the tribes."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_16: "Controlling Berenike"
 blemmia_missions_task_16_DESC: "Berenike on the sea lights the land like a beacon of prosperity, the main node of communication and trade between the desert and the vast world beyond the reach of the Blemmyans. It must be invested in so that the people can enjoy the luxuries and benefits of the world's creation."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_17: "The Camel Trade"
 blemmia_missions_task_17_DESC: "Up and down the Nile, the camels from deserts across the sea have become synonymous with trade and travel, outpacing and lasting longer than the typical horse. For the merchants still clamoring for these beasts of burden, the Blemmyan tribes should provide a steady supply."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_18: "Blemmyan Slave Trade"
 blemmia_missions_task_18_DESC: "From the many raids the tribal bands have performed, we have many surplus slaves to hand off to traders coming from across the see. The markets of the Nabataeans should prove profitable."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_19: "Raiding Thebes"
 blemmia_missions_task_19_DESC: "A bully to the north, the Egyptians have always threatened and invaded Blemmyan lands. To ensure our prosperity and claim part of the rich Nile, the warriors of the Blemmyans should take the fight to their heartland."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_20: "Worship of Mandulis"
 blemmia_missions_task_20_DESC: "The god of the sun, Mandulis presides over the wide pantheon the Blemmyans worship. For his temples along the Nile, it is our duty to service and maintain them under our own rule."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_21: "The Final Island"
 blemmia_missions_task_21_DESC: "Philae, the holy island of Isis and the gods of the Nile, must become the cultural capital of the Blemmyans to establish a lasting history and education of faith among the tribes."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_22: "Ruling the Middle Nile"
 blemmia_missions_task_22_DESC: "Stretching out beyond the desert, the Blemmyans must plow the fertile soil of the Nile and grow our kingdom before slowly withering into obscurity."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_23: "The Golden Rule"
 blemmia_missions_task_23_DESC: "Omboi has been known as the 'Land of Gold,' matching the richness of Luxor and the other great cities of pharaonic Upper Egypt. The Blemmyans have the potential to rebuild its opulence and turn the region into a grand metropolis of wealth fueling growth in the desert."
 
 blemmia_missions_task_24: "A Blemmyan Empire"
 blemmia_missions_task_24_DESC: "To dominate both the Black and Red lands of Libya, the Blemmyans must subjugate all the great powers of the land and form a grand state of the people."
