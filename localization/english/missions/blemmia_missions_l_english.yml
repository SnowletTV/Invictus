blemmia_missions: "Rise of the Red Lands"
blemmia_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The Blemmyan tribes, shrouded in myth, mystery, and misconception, have only ever been a loosely-collected band of raiders. Yet, behind each raid was a purpose. Beyond the banks of the Nile, far into the desert hills and cliffs, a rising state of Blemmyan-Beja tribes was consolidating under what would become a royal line of great kings who rule over ordinary kings and, under them, tribal chiefs. With their sights set on the island of Philae and the cultural/religious centers of Upper Egypt, the Blemmyae will become great challengers to the major powers of the Nile."
blemmia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Blemmyan tribes control the Libyan deserts and the middle stretch of the Nile."

blemmia_missions_task_11_DESC: "On the lands of the Adabuli, the site of Tabot sits idle as a perfect spot for manufacturing great luxury goods for export with the many gem mines in the nearby hills. The people should take to the lands and turn this desolate spot into an emporium."

me_blemmia_1_desc: "Having met with the Adulian council, the Blemmyans have been able to prove a shared heritage and make the case for integrating the Adulians into the greater Blemmyan society.

me_blemmia_4_title: "Red Gold Prospecting"
me_blemmia_4_desc: "A gold rush has taken hold of the Blemmyan red lands. With all the new mines being constructed in mountains, cliffsides, and in caves, those more ambitious among the tribal chiefs wish to prospect for even one more golden vein. Should the Blemmyan people truly pursue such a greedy prospect?"
me_blemmia_4.a: "Search for new mineral pastures."
me_blemmia_4.b: "We have enough gold."
 
me_blemmia_5_title: "Medjay Experience"
me_blemmia_5_desc: "Among the many Medjay warriors to return to Blemmyan lands, a man among them claims to be a leader in the Egyptian police guard.

me_blemmia_9_desc: "While the opening of olivine gem mines has become a boon to the Blemmyan trade routes and negotiations with foreign powers, some greedy members of the Blemmyan bureaucracy believe that Mons Smaragdus can become even more profitable. On the opposite side of the geographic landmark, there exists rumors that the mountain's backside also contains a wealth of green veins. The only danger is that possible excavations of this new part of the mountain may collapse part of the original mine, ruining all of our operations at once - that is, if we even find any emeralds on the mountain's backside. What should be done?"

The Blemmyan magistrate has pointed to the potential of Ptolemais Theron as a key port from which to send out all of the excess emeralds, fixing the issue. Shall the matter be resolved now?"
me_blemmia_10.a: "Yes, invest in the city's future."

me_blemmia_15_title: "It speaks!"
me_blemmia_15_desc: "The Blemmyan Great Chief's dinner was rudely interrupted by screaming and crashing sounds outside on the streets of the capital. All made sense when a hideous creature, short, stout, stocky, and hobbled, entered the great hall. All eyes darted to its wide feet, its crude spear but, most of all, the horrificly inhuman face it wore on its chest, a toothy mouth centered on its torso. Then came the words: a set of clicks and gargled noises, certainly alien in style. The closest one could liken it to was the distinct tongue of the Troglodytes, who utter click-like noises in their cave homes. While the Great Chief's safety was secured, an army of translators gathered. Passing the messages around, one-by-one, the Great Chief came to hear the Blemmye's demands: 'Food. Water. Riches. Give for spears.' Such were its understandable desires, the minutiae of its meaning lost in the endless translation. Shall the Blemmyan ruler deal with this creature?"

The Great Chief's bodyguard and military strategists have suggested including these men in the military hierarchy or having them involve themselves in the training process even though many Blemmyans seem them as strange and alien - their click-based language is difficult to appraoch and they have strange habits.

me_blemmia_21_desc: "As our warriors reach the Nile and the territory of the 20 cities, some rumors have spread that the magistrates of each city in the collective would rather sell his town than accept a siege - perhaps they can be reasoned with?

me_blemmia_23_title: "Bullying Berenike"
me_blemmia_23_desc: "Surrounded by our forces, the officials of Berenike Troglodytike have sent messengers to begin negotiations with the Blemmyan leaders, seeking a peaceful resolution.

me_blemmia_23.a: "Berenike should join the Blemmyan people."
me_blemmia_23.b: "Berenike need only cooperate with our merchants."

me_blemmia_26_title: "Theban Incursion"
me_blemmia_26_desc: "The land of Luxor and Thebai sits rich and vulnerable, the cities themselves oftentimes in open rebellion against the regime in Alexandria. However, they are no friends of the Blemmyans, believing their kind to be superior and more advanced. Therefore, by military might we must show them the power of the Blemmyan tribes."
me_blemmia_26.a: "Send in an advance unit."
me_blemmia_26.b: "Invade as normal."

me_blemmia_28_desc: "A cultural center for all who tether their lives to the Nile and its environs, Philae stands out as a beacon of unity, cultural mixture, and holy woship to all peoples of the great Libyan expanse. To many Blemmyan people, the place is more sacred than any of the current capitals or any holy sites out in the desert. It may be time to move the throne to this magnificent place and rule from a central node on the world's grandest river."
me_blemmia_28.a: "Philae Island will become the center of the Blemmyan realm."
me_blemmia_28.b: "The Red Lands are where we shall always hail."

me_blemmia_29_desc: "With the harshest stretches of the Nile under Blemmyan control, the lower and upper limits of it are but left to take at will. The might of Egypt and Kush, cleft in two by our incursion, stand curbed by the power of the Red Land tribes."
me_blemmia_29.a: "The kings of the Nile shall be Blemmyan."
