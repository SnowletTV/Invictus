 blemmia_missions:0 "Rise of the Red Lands"
 blemmia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Blemmyan tribes, shrouded in myth, mystery, and misconception, have only ever been a loosely-collected band of raiders. Yet, behind each raid was a purpose. Beyond the banks of the Nile, far into the desert hills and cliffs, a rising state of Blemmyan-Beja tribes was consolidating under what would become a royal line of great kings who rule over ordinary kings and, under them, tribal chiefs. With their sights set on the island of Philae and the cultural/religious centers of Upper Egypt, the Blemmyae will become great challengers to the major powers of the Nile."
 blemmia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when the Blemmyan tribes control the Libyan deserts and the middle stretch of the Nile."

 blemmia_missions_task_11:0 "Tabot Workshops"
 blemmia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "On the lands of the Adabuli, the site of Tabot sits idle as a perfect spot for manufacturing great luxury goods for export with the many gem mines in the nearby hills. The people should take to the lands and turn this desolate spot into an emporium."

 me_blemmia_4_title:0 "Red Gold Prospecting"
 me_blemmia_4_desc:0 "A gold rush has taken hold of the Blemmyan red lands.

On the opposite side of the geographic landmark, there exists rumors that the mountain's backside also contains a wealth of green veins. The only danger is that possible excavations of this new part of the mountain may collapse part of the original mine, ruining all of our operations at once - that is, if we even find any emeralds on the mountain's backside.

All made sense when a hideous creature, short, stout, stocky, and hobbled, entered the great hall. All eyes darted to its wide feet, its crude spear but, most of all, the horrificly inhuman face it wore on its chest, a toothy mouth centered on its torso. Then came the words: a set of clicks and gargled noises, certainly alien in style. The closest one could liken it to was the distinct tongue of the Troglodytes, who utter click-like noises in their cave homes. While the Great Chief's safety was secured, an army of translators gathered. Passing the messages around, one-by-one, the Great Chief came to hear the Blemmye's demands: 'Food. Water. Riches. Give for spears.' Such were its understandable desires, the minutiae of its meaning lost in the endless translation. Shall the Blemmyan ruler deal with this creature?"
