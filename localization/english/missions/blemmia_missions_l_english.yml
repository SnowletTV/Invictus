blemmia_missions: "Rise of the Red Lands"
blemmia_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The Blemmyan tribes, shrouded in myth, mystery, and misconception, have only ever been a loosely-collected band of raiders. Yet, behind each raid was a purpose. Beyond the banks of the Nile, far into the desert hills and cliffs, a rising state of Blemmyan-Beja tribes was consolidating under what would become a royal line of great kings who rule over ordinary kings and, under them, tribal chiefs. With their sights set on the island of Philae and the cultural/religious centers of Upper Egypt, the Blemmyae will become great challengers to the major powers of the Nile."
blemmia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Blemmyan tribes control the Libyan deserts and the middle stretch of the Nile."

blemmia_missions_task_10_DESC: "To the east of the Nile, few peoples can confidently travel the dunes, the barren straits, and the empty fields of the Red Land which lies between river and sea.

blemmia_missions_task_11: "Tabot Workshops"
blemmia_missions_task_11_DESC: "On the lands of the Adabuli, the site of Tabot sits idle as a perfect spot for manufacturing great luxury goods for export with the many gem mines in the nearby hills. The people should take to the lands and turn this desolate spot into an emporium."

blemmia_missions_task_12_DESC: "Those from far off lands know nothing of the true Blemmyan people and have come to confuse the desert-dwellers with monstrous, headless men who wear faces on their chests.

blemmia_missions_task_13: "The Trogodytes"
blemmia_missions_task_13_DESC: "A tribe among the Blemmyans, the Trogodytes are another confused people.

blemmia_missions_task_14_DESC: "The twenty cities along the middle-stretch of the Nile, leading to the island of Philae, have always stood out as prosperous and worthy for cattle, grain, slaves, and riches.

blemmia_missions_task_17: "The Camel Trade"
blemmia_missions_task_17_DESC: "Up and down the Nile, the camels from deserts across the sea have become synonymous with trade and travel, outpacing and lasting longer than the typical horse.

blemmia_missions_task_18: "Blemmyan Slave Trade"
blemmia_missions_task_18_DESC: "From the many raids the tribal bands have performed, we have many surplus slaves to hand off to traders coming from across the see. The markets of the Nabataeans should prove profitable."

me_blemmia_1_title: "Adding the Adulians"
me_blemmia_1_desc: "Having met with the Adulian council, the Blemmyans have been able to prove a shared heritage and make the case for integrating the Adulians into the greater Blemmyan society. However, many Adulian elders feel nervous about abandoning their autonomy and becoming part of a greater whole. How shall the Blemmyans solve this predicament?"

me_blemmia_3.a: "Now, to the mines!"
 
me_blemmia_4_title: "Red Gold Prospecting"
me_blemmia_4_desc: "A gold rush has taken hold of the Blemmyan red lands. With all the new mines being constructed in mountains, cliffsides, and in caves, those more ambitious among the tribal chiefs wish to prospect for even one more golden vein. Should the Blemmyan people truly pursue such a greedy prospect?"
me_blemmia_4.a: "Search for new mineral pastures."
me_blemmia_4.b: "We have enough gold."
 
me_blemmia_5_title: "Medjay Experience"
me_blemmia_5_desc: "Among the many Medjay warriors to return to Blemmyan lands, a man among them claims to be a leader in the Egyptian police guard.

me_blemmia_9_desc: "While the opening of olivine gem mines has become a boon to the Blemmyan trade routes and negotiations with foreign powers, some greedy members of the Blemmyan bureaucracy believe that Mons Smaragdus can become even more profitable. On the opposite side of the geographic landmark, there exists rumors that the mountain's backside also contains a wealth of green veins. The only danger is that possible excavations of this new part of the mountain may collapse part of the original mine, ruining all of our operations at once - that is, if we even find any emeralds on the mountain's backside. What should be done?"
me_blemmia_9.a: "Dive into the mountain!"

me_blemmia_10_desc: "The trade along the salty coast of the Red Lands has become a river of olivine gems from the mines of Mons Smaragdus. Yet, as quickly as we are able to mine these gems, we do not have the infrastructure to export them at the greatest of speeds. The Blemmyan magistrate has pointed to the potential of Ptolemais Theron as a key port from which to send out all of the excess emeralds, fixing the issue. Shall the matter be resolved now?"
me_blemmia_10.a: "Yes, invest in the city's future."

me_blemmia_11.a: "The roads have allowed us to bring new goods into our lands."
me_blemmia_11.b: "We must further improve the quality of the roads."
