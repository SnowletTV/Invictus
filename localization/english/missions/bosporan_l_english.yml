#Missions

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_1: "Taking Taurica"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_1_DESC: "To our west lies two implacable foes; the sons of [GetCountry('CHS').GetName|Y], who are our wayward kinsmen, and the menacing #G Scythians#!, who are a powerful threat that are not to be underestimated.\n\nBe this as it may, we cannot allow any rivals to hold onto territories within the province of #T Taurica#!, and so a time of war is almost upon us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_2: "Tyras And Olbia"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_2_DESC: "Now that the Bosporan cities of [GetProvince('(int32)4544').GetName|Y] and [GetProvince('(int32)4536').GetName|Y] are ruled by the #G House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]#!, the time has come to build upon these successes by taking the remaining territories to our west that have a large Bosporan population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_3: "The Battle For The Borysthenes"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_3_DESC: "Although the warriors of the #G Scythians#! and #G Iazygians#! will resist us fiercely, we cannot allow the overwhelming numbers of the barbarian tribes to prevent us from securing our realm. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made it known that we consider our natural borders to extend up to the #T River Borysthenes#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil11!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_4: "A Farewell To Kings"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_4_DESC: "With the Scythians on the retreat and our western flank secure, we can now turn our attention to the #E Caucasian#! tribes to our east and their Tribal Chieftains that rule as petty kings.\n\nOur great Basileus #Y Leukon#! conquered the proud #E Sindians#! once before, and if the Caucasians do not wish for war with his successors, then they will have to submit to us peacefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_5: "Expand The Warm Water Port"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_5_DESC: "The port city of [GetProvince('(int32)4544').GetName|Y], gloriously captured by our ruler #E Leukon I#! a couple of generations ago, is one of our most prized possessions, for its waters do not freeze during the harsh northern winters. By expanding the infrastructure of Theodosia, we will ensure that merchant ships from the wider world continue to visit our cities all year round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_6: "The Battle Of Gorgippia"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_6_DESC: "Unfortunately for us, the waters of the #G Pontus Euxinus#! are infested with pirates - these bold brigands even operate freely from one of our territories, [GetProvince('(int32)4565').GetName|Y], and it is said that much plunder is hidden behind the city's walls.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that this state of affairs has gone on long enough. We need to protect our economic interests from these dastardly raiders that have no respect for our laws. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has ordered a large fleet to be built, for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] plans to launch a daring attack against the pirates of Gorgippia in hopes of seizing their wealth.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_7: "Athenian Bread"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_7_DESC: "Long ago, our leader #E Leucon I#! granted the citizens of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName|Y] certain trading privileges, for the inhabitants of Attica are not blessed with a surplus of grain @grain! like we are and their merchants are always seeking a steady supply of food.\n\nNow that we have the infrastructure in [GetProvince('(int32)4544').GetName|Y] to export year round, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] desires to renew the understanding we once enjoyed with the Athenians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_8: "The Pirates Of Pityous"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_8_DESC: "In [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] quest to drive the brigands and raiders out of the #G Pontus Euxinus#!, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has vowed to eliminate the pirate haven located in [GetProvince('(int32)1743').GetName|Y]. The pirates of Pityous have long threatened the coasts leading up to [GetProvince('(int32)4563').GetName|Y], but their hour is at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_9: "Cimmerian Bosporus"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_9_DESC: "With both sides of the #Y Cimmerian Bosporus#! firmly in hand, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has now turned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention towards building up the cities on either side of the #Y Bosporus Cimmerius#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil2!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_10: "The Iron Of [GetProvince('(int32)4549').GetName]"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_10_DESC: "The city of [GetProvince('(int32)4549').GetName|Y] produces excellent quality iron @iron!, and it would be wise to do everything possible to expand our production. Our armies deserve to be equipped with nothing but the finest, and the blacksmiths of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are ready and waiting to forge the weapons that will win us victory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_11: "The Silver Chain"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_11_DESC: "It has been proposed by our military engineers that we build a massive chain across the #G Cimmerian Bosporus#!, one that will control the flow of traffic in and out of the #Y Palus Maeotica#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_12: "Taming Tanais"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_12_DESC: "Located within the foul waters of the #G Maeotian Marshes#! to our north, [GetProvince('(int32)4557').GetName|Y] has long remained a beacon of light and civilization in the region, despite its unhealthy climate. Now that we have taken control of Tanais for ourselves, we must build upon its sturdy foundations and create the most important city within the province of #E Bosproranum#! - a place worthy of Bosporan settlers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_13: "The Peaceful Sea"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_13_DESC: "Let us complete the good work that #E Leukon I#! began and finish off the scourge of brigandry within the #G Pontus Euxinus#! once and for all. No matter where they may be found, we will destroy the pirate havens along the coasts and bring peace and prosperity to the trade lanes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_14: "Scythian Steppe Riders"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_14_DESC: "There have been many times in recent memory when we have had to rely on the manpower of the #Y Scythians#! to settle our disputes - who living among us does not remember the civil wars of #E Eumelos#! and the carnage that his horse archers caused? The help of the barbarian warriors proved to be indispensible in our time of need.\n\nNow that [GetProvince('(int32)4557').GetName|Y] has become a true Bosporan city, messengers have been sent north into the steppes at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s command. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has need of horse archers and is willing to pay a tidy sum in order to procure the services of such riders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil11!"

01_bosporan_kingdom_task_16: "Bosporan Bosporus"
01_bosporan_kingdom_task_16_DESC: "Although the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]s have been successful in their efforts to drive the pirates from the #G Pontus Euxinus#!, there are still some scoundrels that are causing mischief in our waters, and it is known that they are launching their raids from [GetProvince('(int32)248').GetName|Y].\n\nEven though the cities on the coasts of the #G Propontis#! are angered by our presence in their waters, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has not been intimidated by their threats and has promised to set the pirate den at Myrleia to the torch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil22!"
