A family known as the #E Archaeanactids#! ruled over the Bosporans for about fifty years before our ancestor, the mercenary #E Spartokis I#!, overthrew them and established his own dynasty.\n\nTwo strong Basileis, #E Leukon#! and #E Paerisades#!, ruled over us for a prosperous seven decades, but the last five years have brought nothing but devastation and ruinous civil war to the realm, for the three sons of the Paerisades ignored his deathbed wishes and chose to fight amongst each other for the throne. The struggle between the brothers was brief, however, and the middle child #E Eumelus#! defeated both #E Satyrus#!, the chosen heir, and the foolish #E Prytanis#! within a year.\n\nEumelus had lost the #E Battle of the River Thatis#!, a major engagement in which tens of thousands of men on both sides perished, but he overcame this setback and ultimately emerged the victor, showing no mercy to his brothers or their friends. Eumelus ruled a brief five years before dying in a tragic accident involving his carriage - fulfilling a witch's prophecy regarding the dangers of 'houses that move' - and his successor, the young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], has only been in power for a few months.\n\nSurrounded by savage #E Scythians#! and other barbarians, the Bosporans have found themselves fighting alongside and against their neighbors at various times in their history - Eumelus would have never won his war without the aid of the #E Sarmatians#! allies - and their looming presence, like the vast and endless steppe that lies beyond the forests of Taurica, remains a reality that the isolated Bosporans will have to contend with. Raids from the northern tribes are growing with alarming frequency, and the #E Wars of the Diadochi#! that have gripped the south have made the waters of the #E Pontus Euxinus#! a dangerous place to be."

This so-called 'Silver Chain' that glistens brightly in the sun is actually made of iron from the mills and foundries of [GetProvince('(int32)4549').GetName], and all ships that seek to enter the ports of the Bosporans must be given permission to pass into the harbors that are blocked off by this chain.\n\nNeedless to say, smuggling goods in and out of the region is all but impossible, although some fools periodically try and fail miserably. Most merchants are honorable men, however, and are willing to pay a little extra in taxes to gain access to the marketplaces of the #E Cimmerian Bosporus#!."
