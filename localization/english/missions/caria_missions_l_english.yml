Even in the days of the Bronze Age, our forebears roamed the seas as mercenaries and traders. Under Lygdamis, Artemisia, Mausolus, and Ada Caria assembled formidable fleets, securing dominance over much of the Aegean. Yet for too long, our seafaring strength has been wielded in the service of others. Now, the time has come to build a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] war fleet-not for the ambitions of our masters, but to secure our own destiny on the waves!"

###Notes


#As of now, Macedon gets an event where (if the conditions are right) the Diadochi agree to let Pleistarchus take a satrapy of his own. He can be given Caria or Cilicia, becoming a satrap, and Macedon gets some former Antigonid subjects in the area they choose. Another of the Diadochi can appoint a satrap to the province not given to Pleistarchus. However, he can also be given the independent governorship of both Cilicia and Caria as a Macedonian ally.
#If we were trying to be a historically accurate as possible, then Pleistarchus should probably be given Cilicia. Demetrius would get an event to retake it and if successful, Pleistarchus/Cassander could appeal to Lysmachus for Caria. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well  from a gameplay perspective.
#I haven't implemented it, but I had planned for some further events about Pleistarchus and Caria. Eupolemus would eventually get gout, and Eupolemus, his second in command, would suggest that Pleistarchus step down and give the reins over to himself. If Pleistarchus refused, then there would be a chance for him to be found dead in his bed a few months later. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that looks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state. There would also be a chance for Eupolemus to ask a foreign power (usually Lysmachus) for assistance in assassinating Pleistarchus. If Thrace cooperated, then they would invite Pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. While attendingPleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock. If successful, Eupolemus will swear fealty to Lysimachus.


#Add a bunch of events for caria
#Event for Demetrius to declare war on Cilicia
#The overlord should get a event to cede it or prepare for war
#Eupolemus event to take power
#He can ask a foreign power for assistance in assassinating pleistarchus
#The diadochi get an event about pleistarchus getting gout
#5-10 years after getting Caria
#Eupolemus feels that week was cannot be tolerated
#He asks the ruler to step down

#A few months later the ruler might be found dead in his bed. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that loooks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state.
#Another option requires Thrace’s cooperation. They will invite pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. There pleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock
#Eupolemus will swear fealty to lysmachos
#Option for Kassandros to attend
