 caria_missions_task_1:0 "Strength in Service"
 caria_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The future of Caria is clearly entwined with that of our mighty overlords, the #E [ROOT.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective]s#!. While it may be tempting to assert greater independence, now is not the time for such actions. It would only invite conflict and suspicion.  Instead, wisdom dictates a different course-one that strengthens our standing and secures our prominence within their domain."

 caria_missions_task_2:0 "Proving Our Worth"
 caria_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Caria has long demonstrated its value to the great powers of the Aegean and Near East. Under Persian rule, our skilled sailors and mercenaries played vital roles in their campaigns, while the Hekatomnids elevated Caria to unprecedented heights of wealth and influence. Alexander the Great entrusted Queen Ada with Caria's governance as a loyal ally rather than a mere subject. Now, we must once again prove to the #E [ROOT.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective]s#! that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] would be more valuable to them not merely a subject to be governed but as an indispensable ally."

 caria_missions_task_3:0 "Naval Academy"
 caria_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "The Carians have a long and storied naval tradition, serving as commanders, shipbuilders, and warriors in the fleets of mighty empires. Even in the days of the Bronze Age, our forebears roamed the seas as mercenaries and traders. Under Lygdamis, Artemisia, Mausolus, and Ada, Caria assembled formidable fleets, securing dominance over much of the Aegean. Yet for too long, our seafaring strength has been wielded in the service of others.\n\nWe shall construct a naval academy in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to train our next generation of sailors and naval commanders."

 caria_missions_task_4:0 "War Fleet"
 caria_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Carians have a long and storied naval tradition, serving as commanders, shipbuilders, and warriors in the fleets of mighty empires. Even in the days of the Bronze Age, our forebears roamed the seas as mercenaries and traders. Under Lygdamis, Artemisia, Mausolus, and Ada, Caria assembled formidable fleets, securing dominance over much of the Aegean. Yet for too long, our seafaring strength has been wielded in the service of others.\n\nNow, the time has come to build a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] war fleet-not for the ambitions of our masters, but to secure our own destiny on the waves!"

 caria_missions_task_5:0 "The Artemisia"
 caria_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Ships with ten rowers or more per side were first employed by Alexander the Great but became even more commonplace after the Antigonid navies used them in the siege of Tyre and beyond. Such a ship will always have an extremely limited maneuverability in a pitched naval battle. For siege warfare however these 'Mega Polyremes' are ideal as they are able to break open seaside walls and then act as platforms for artillery while also allowing great number of troops to land. It is only right that we construct such vessels for ourselves, for what royal navy is complete without a mighty flagship?"
 caria_missions_task_5_tt:0 "We will gain a #E Mega Polyreme#! in the #Y Mare Phoenicum#! with a highly competent admiral to command it"

 caria_missions_task_6:0 "Donning the Diadem"
 caria_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "The greatest of the Diadochi, now style themselves as kings, 'Basileis,' not satraps. Caria has known queens and dynasts, warlords and visionaries. We now rule not as mere servants of distant powers but as sovereigns in our own right.\n\nAnd still, some call our ruler 'Satrapes,' a title of subordination. That will not do. The diadem awaits, and with it the recognition of our rightful place among the successors of Alexander."

 caria_missions_task_7:0 "The Pleistarchid Kingdom"
 caria_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Pleistarchos's father, Antipater, ruled Macedon as Regent of the Kings, and his brother Kassandros cast aside the old titles of subordination to declare himself Basileus, founding a dynasty of his own. Are we to be less bold than Kassandros?\n\nThough our base is in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we are no longer bound to its narrow borders. Our ambitions stretch far beyond. Let us reorganize [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into 'The Pleistarchid Kingdom,' a kingdom not inherited, but earned."

 caria_missions_task_8:0 "Correcting Chios"
 caria_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Thucydides once called the Chians 'the wealthiest Greeks,' and not without reason. With nearly 900 square kilometers of fertile land, soaring peaks, and access to the eastern seas, the island is a world unto itself, and far too valuable to be left to the whims of democracy.\n\nIn the days of Mausolos, the Chian oligarchs wisely cast out the democrats and aligned themselves with Caria, forming a league with Rhodes, Kos, and Byzantion. But as with all unstable things, democracy returned with Alexander's conquests. Now, the time has come to correct that mistake. We shall assist the island's natural leaders in reclaiming their place, and in doing so, bring Chios once more under the Carian aegis. We will settle their land disputes with the Erythraians by treaty or by spear...""

 caria_missions_task_9:0 "Prince of Priene"
 caria_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "Hieron, one of Priene's preeminent nobles, has made no attempt to conceal his desire for hereditary power. Though the city clings to the trappings of democracy, its people are weary of factional strife and foreign entanglements. If we offer the support of even a portion of our forces, Hieron could seize control and rule as a prince, ushering in a new order under our aegis.\n\nHome to the revered Sanctuary of Athena Polias and the meeting place of the Ionian League, nPriene possess immense symbolic and strategic value. To wrest control of Priene would deal a devastating blow to the Antigonid-dominated Ionian League and open the door for Carian dominance across Ionia."

 caria_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "The age of kings is upon us. The heirs of Alexander, no longer content to call themselves satraps, now style themselves as Basileis, and each builds their empire in the image of their founder. The world is no longer ruled by men alone, but by ferocious beasts.\n\nTo the south, the Ptolemies soar like eagles: aloof, imperial, and swift to strike. To the east, the Seleucids advance on elephantine feet: immense, deliberate, and unstoppable. To the north, the Lysimachid roar like lions, ever hungering for territory and glory.\n\nEach watches Caria, and each harbors quiet designs on our coasts. But perhaps we need not face them in battle. Of course, peace comes at a price. A royal marriage, accompanied by the dowry of Halikarnassus, may yet turn predator into partner."

 caria_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The world grows darker by the year. The Diadochi clash without end, pirates infest the seas, and the ambitions of rough generals swell with each passing season. In such times, prudence must come before pride.\n\nOur recent alliance with the Ptolemies has brought wealth and recognition, but we must now ask whether a deeper bond is needed.

In such times, prudence must come before pride.\n\nOur recent alliance with Lysimachos has brought strength and status, but the lion is not easily satisfied. His hunger for territory and dominance is well known, and already he casts a wary eye toward the Aegean. By formally becoming a Lysimachid Satrapes, we may trade a measure of sovereignty for lasting security.

 caria_missions_task_14:0 "Walls of Halikarnassos"
 caria_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "Halikarnassos, once defied the greatest conqueror of the age. When Alexander laid siege to the city in 334 BC, it held firm for months under the command of Memnon of Rhodes, and though it fell in the end, its defenses earned the respect of all Hellas. Since then, Halikarnassos has changed hands more than once, as the Diadochi fought like wolves over the spoils of empire.\n\nBut no longer. Let the kings and satraps scheme as they will, Halikarnassos shall not be their prize. We will rebuild her walls, reinforce her harbors, and restore her towers. The city will stand as an impregnable bastion of Carian power, and those who seek to take her must pay a terrible price."


 caria_missions_task_15:0 "Heirs of Hekatomnos"
 caria_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "The line of Hekatomnos brought Caria to greatness. From their ancestral seat in Mylasa, the Hekatomnids rose to power as satraps of Caria and masters of its highlands and coasts alike. Under Mausolos and Artemisia, Halikarnassos rose to fame, its monuments rivaling those of ancient dynasties, its fleets commanding the seas, its court hosting poets, scholars, and soldiers. Even in its twilight, the dynasty endured with honor: Queen Ada, last of the Hekatomnids, adopted Alexander the Great as her son. Now, with Halikarnassos once more secured, it is only fitting that we entrust its rule to a cadet branch of that noble house."

 caria_missions_task_16:0 "Hekatomnid Restoration"
 caria_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "For too long, Caria has bent the knee to Persians, to Macedonians, to self-styled kings with no roots in our soil. No more, Caria remembers. In the mountain sanctuaries of Mylasa, in the harbor-taverns, of Halikarnassos, in the hearts of the people, the old loyalties endure. They whisper of a rising, of vengeance, of restoration.\n\nIt is time. Caria shall be ruled by Carians once more. The heirs of Hekatomnos will reclaim what is rightfully theirs, not as satraps, but as sovereigns. Let the usurper tremble. Revolution is at hand! Already, word reaches us of a plot against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. In the halls of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] palace, daggers are drawn in shadow, and poison waits in golden cups."
 caria_missions_task_16_tt:0 "We may choose to intervene and save [THIS.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], or permit the assassination to proceed.\n\nIf the plot succeeds, the following will occur:\nA Hekatomnid becomes the ruler of [THIS.GetCountry.GetName]"

 caria_missions_task_17:0 "Kaunian Coins"
 caria_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "While the material remains of Kaunos date its foundation or early site-use to at most the 9th century BC, the traditional history of the city dates back to its namesake, Kaunos, the son of the Carian King Miletus and the naiad Kyane. It is said that Kaunos and his sister, Byblis, fell in love and that, in order to avoid incest, Kaunos fled her company all the way to Lycia in Anatolia. Here, Byblis followed him but fell into sorrow and madness and died, turning into a spring, crying her incessant tears over the land and creating with her watery eyes the river the Calbys river. In Asia, Kaunos married the nymph Pronoe and had a son, Aegialus, who went on to found a city nearby, named for his father. The city itself was an excellent trade harbor, having two functioning ports, and Herodotus notes that the people of the city resiliently fought against the Persian general Harpagus - they did, after a while, lose. The historian also notes that while he personally disagrees with their claim of their own foreign origin, because they speak a language similar to that of his own home, he cannot deny that they act in a peculiar manner, different from all the other Carians and Lycians. All the men, women, and even the children drink wine together.\n\nIf we harbor ambitions to stand among the heirs of Alexander, we must do as they do. We shall establish a royal mint at Kaunos, striking coinage in our name."

 caria_missions_task_18:0 "Lord of Lycia"
 caria_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Mausolos, the great architect of Carian power, knew that empire is not built by one hand alone. To secure his southern frontier, he entrusted the rule of Lycia to his brother, Pixodaros. We would do well to follow his example. The Lycian cities, from Xanthos to Patara, are proud and fractious, but are strategically vital."
#Any land held by us or our subjects will be given to Lycia

###Notes


#As of now, Macedon gets an event where (if the conditions are right) the Diadochi agree to let Pleistarchus take a satrapy of his own. He can be given Caria or Cilicia, becoming a satrap, and Macedon gets some former Antigonid subjects in the area they choose. Another of the Diadochi can appoint a satrap to the province not given to Pleistarchus. However, he can also be given the independent governorship of both Cilicia and Caria as a Macedonian ally.
#If we were trying to be a historically accurate as possible, then Pleistarchus should probably be given Cilicia. Demetrius would get an event to retake it and if successful, Pleistarchus/Cassander could appeal to Lysmachus for Caria. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well  from a gameplay perspective.
#I haven't implemented it, but I had planned for some further events about Pleistarchus and Caria. Eupolemus would eventually get gout, and Eupolemus, his second in command, would suggest that Pleistarchus step down and give the reins over to himself. If Pleistarchus refused, then there would be a chance for him to be found dead in his bed a few months later. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that looks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state. There would also be a chance for Eupolemus to ask a foreign power (usually Lysmachus) for assistance in assassinating Pleistarchus. If Thrace cooperated, then they would invite Pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. While attendingPleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock. If successful, Eupolemus will swear fealty to Lysimachus.


#Add a bunch of events for caria
#Event for Demetrius to declare war on Cilicia
#The overlord should get a event to cede it or prepare for war
#Eupolemus event to take power
#He can ask a foreign power for assistance in assassinating pleistarchus
#The diadochi get an event about pleistarchus getting gout
#5-10 years after getting Caria
#Eupolemus feels that week was cannot be tolerated
#He asks the ruler to step down

#A few months later the ruler might be found dead in his bed. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that loooks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state.
#Another option requires Thrace’s cooperation. They will invite pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. There pleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock
#Eupolemus will swear fealty to lysmachos
#Option for Kassandros to attend
