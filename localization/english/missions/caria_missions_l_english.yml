 #Missions
 
 caria_missions_task_1:0 "Strength in Service"
 caria_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The future of Caria is clearly entwined with that of our mighty overlords, the #E [ROOT.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective]s#!. While it may be tempting to assert greater independence, now is not the time for such actions. It would only invite conflict and suspicion.  Instead, wisdom dictates a different course-one that strengthens our standing and secures our prominence within their domain."

 caria_missions_task_2:0 "Proving Our Worth"
 caria_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Caria has long demonstrated its value to the great powers of the Aegean and Near East. Under Persian rule, our skilled sailors and mercenaries played vital roles in their campaigns, while the Hekatomnids elevated Caria to unprecedented heights of wealth and influence. Alexander the Great entrusted Queen Ada with Caria's governance as a loyal ally rather than a mere subject. Now, we must once again prove to the #E [ROOT.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective]s#! that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] would be more valuable to them not merely a subject to be governed but as an indispensable ally."

 caria_missions_task_3:0 "Naval Academy"
 caria_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "The Carians have a long and storied naval tradition, serving as commanders, shipbuilders, and warriors in the fleets of mighty empires. Even in the days of the Bronze Age, our forebears roamed the seas as mercenaries and traders. Under Lygdamis, Artemisia, Mausolus, and Ada, Caria assembled formidable fleets, securing dominance over much of the Aegean. Yet for too long, our seafaring strength has been wielded in the service of others.\n\nWe shall construct a naval academy in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to train our next generation of sailors and naval commanders."

 caria_missions_task_4:0 "Royal Fleet"
 caria_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Carians have a long and storied naval tradition, serving as commanders, shipbuilders, and warriors in the fleets of mighty empires. Even in the days of the Bronze Age, our forebears roamed the seas as mercenaries and traders. Under Lygdamis, Artemisia, Mausolus, and Ada, Caria assembled formidable fleets, securing dominance over much of the Aegean. Yet for too long, our seafaring strength has been wielded in the service of others.\n\nNow, the time has come to build a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] war fleet-not for the ambitions of our masters, but to secure our own destiny on the waves!"

 caria_missions_task_5:0 "The Artemisia"
 caria_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Ships with ten rowers or more per side were first employed by Alexander the Great but became even more commonplace after the Antigonid navies used them in the siege of Tyre and beyond. Such a ship will always have an extremely limited maneuverability in a pitched naval battle. For siege warfare however these 'Mega Polyremes' are ideal as they are able to break open seaside walls and then act as platforms for artillery while also allowing great number of troops to land. It is only right that we construct such vessels for ourselves, for what royal navy is complete without a mighty flagship?"
 caria_missions_task_5_tt:0 "We will gain a #E Mega Polyreme#! in the #Y Mare Phoenicum#! with a highly competent admiral to command it"

 caria_missions_task_6:0 "Donning the Diadem"
 caria_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "The greatest of the Diadochi, now style themselves as kings, 'Basileis,' not satraps. Caria has known queens and dynasts, warlords and visionaries. We now rule not as mere servants of distant powers but as sovereigns in our own right.\n\nAnd still, some call our ruler 'Satrapes,' a title of subordination. That will not do. The diadem awaits, and with it the recognition of our rightful place among the successors of Alexander."

 caria_missions_task_7:0 "The Pleistarchid Kingdom"
 caria_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Pleistarchos's father, Antipater, ruled Macedon as Regent of the Kings, and his brother Kassandros cast aside the old titles of subordination to declare himself Basileus, founding a dynasty of his own. Are we to be less bold than Kassandros?\n\nThough our base is in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we are no longer bound to its narrow borders. Our ambitions stretch far beyond. Let us reorganize [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into 'The Pleistarchid Kingdom,' a kingdom not inherited, but earned."

 caria_missions_task_8:0 "Correcting Chios"
 caria_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Thucydides once called the Chians 'the wealthiest Greeks,' and not without reason. With nearly 900 square kilometers of fertile land, soaring peaks, and access to the eastern seas, the island is a world unto itself, and far too valuable to be left to the whims of democracy.\n\nIn the days of Mausolos, the Chian oligarchs wisely cast out the democrats and aligned themselves with Caria, forming a league with Rhodes, Kos, and Byzantion. But as with all unstable things, democracy returned with Alexander's conquests. Now, the time has come to correct that mistake. We shall assist the island's natural leaders in reclaiming their place, and in doing so, bring Chios once more under the Carian aegis. We will settle their land disputes with the Erythraians by treaty or by spear...""
 caria_missions_task_8_allow_tt:0 "Have a fleet of at least #G 30#! ships off the shore of #E Chios#!"
 caria_missions_task_8_tt:0 "#E Chios#! becomes an  #E @[THIS.GetCountry.GetFlag]!  [THIS.GetCountry.GetAdjective]#! #Y Feudatory#!\n"[THIS.GetCountry.GetName] will gain Claims on the Areas of #Y Ionia#! and #Y Aeolia#!"

###Notes


#As of now, Macedon gets an event where (if the conditions are right) the Diadochi agree to let Pleistarchus take a satrapy of his own. He can be given Caria or Cilicia, becoming a satrap, and Macedon gets some former Antigonid subjects in the area they choose. Another of the Diadochi can appoint a satrap to the province not given to Pleistarchus. However, he can also be given the independent governorship of both Cilicia and Caria as a Macedonian ally.
#If we were trying to be a historically accurate as possible, then Pleistarchus should probably be given Cilicia. Demetrius would get an event to retake it and if successful, Pleistarchus/Cassander could appeal to Lysmachus for Caria. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well  from a gameplay perspective.
#I haven't implemented it, but I had planned for some further events about Pleistarchus and Caria. Eupolemus would eventually get gout, and Eupolemus, his second in command, would suggest that Pleistarchus step down and give the reins over to himself. If Pleistarchus refused, then there would be a chance for him to be found dead in his bed a few months later. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that looks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state. There would also be a chance for Eupolemus to ask a foreign power (usually Lysmachus) for assistance in assassinating Pleistarchus. If Thrace cooperated, then they would invite Pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. While attendingPleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock. If successful, Eupolemus will swear fealty to Lysimachus.


#Add a bunch of events for caria
#Event for Demetrius to declare war on Cilicia
#The overlord should get a event to cede it or prepare for war
#Eupolemus event to take power
#He can ask a foreign power for assistance in assassinating pleistarchus
#The diadochi get an event about pleistarchus getting gout
#5-10 years after getting Caria
#Eupolemus feels that week was cannot be tolerated
#He asks the ruler to step down

#A few months later the ruler might be found dead in his bed. The court physicians claim that he succumbed to his disease, but there’s bruising on his neck that loooks like strangulation marks. No matter, Eupolemus will naturally take over the affairs of state.
#Another option requires Thrace’s cooperation. They will invite pleistarchus to the capital as a guest of honor for a great feast. There pleistarchus will die in bed. The doctors and Eupolemus claim that the consumption got him, but some remark that his room smells like rat urine, a telltale sign of hemlock
#Eupolemus will swear fealty to lysmachos
#Option for Kassandros to attend
