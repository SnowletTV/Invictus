 cyr_magas_01.1.t:0 "A New Governor for Cyrenaica"
 cyr_magas_01.1.desc:0 "Formally part of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greek colonies of Cyrenaica have been in disarray ever since the previous Ptolemaic governor was killed by his Syracusan allies during a failed invasion of Carthage in 444 AUC (309 BCE). As a new official governor hasn't been appointed yet, a group of local Greek elites currently remains in control of the country. \n\nFor now the gaze of our Egyptian overlords is locked firmly on their rivals in the east, but it is only a question of time until the Ptolemies will appoint a new governor for our region. And once they do they will likely demand closer integration with Egypt. \n\nMaybe we could ensure Egypt of our continued loyalty by approaching them to request a new governor before they make a decision on the matter. This might also allow us to maintain a greater degree of independence than other Egyptian holdings…  "

Berenike herself is the grand-nice of the former Macedonian regent [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetFullName] and a distant relative of Alexander the Great, making her a women of exceptionally high status even before her marriage to Ptolemaios.  \n\nBetween the military talents of his father and the heritage and political connections of his mother, Magas will allow Cyrenaica to play an important role in the wars over Alexander's legacy."

 cyr_magas_01.12.desc:0 "Influenced by the teachings of Buddhist missionaries, [death_persuader.GetName], a prominent philosopher of the Cyrenaic School, has produced a particularly radical form of Cyrenaic philosophy. Like other Cyrenaic philosopher he believes that achieving happiness is the only purpose of life, and that anything that doesn't result in greater happiness is fundamentally meaningless. [death_persuader.GetName] goes further however by arguing that true happiness is unachievable in life, and that life itself is thus meaningless - even going so far as to claim that 'The sage man is indifferent between life and death.'. \n\n[death_persuader.GetName] has collected his teachings in a book called 'Death by Starvation'. Rumour has it that hundreds who have read the book have been convinced to take their own life rather than continue to suffer the pains of existence. From this derives the name under which [death_persuader.GetName] has become infamous:0 'Peisithanatos', 'the Death-Persuader'. \n\n While some of these claims are certainly exaggerated, there is no doubt that 'Death by Starvation' is amongst the greatest works of philosophy of the current generation."

 cyr_magas_01.13.t:0 "The Libyans"
 cyr_magas_01.13.desc:0 "The Libyans have inhabited [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName] since long before the arrival of the first Greek settlers. Traditionally, the Libyans have lived a nomadic lifestyle, herding goats, sheep and other animals. Since the arrival of the Cyrenaican Greeks, many of the northern Libyans near the Greek cities have settled down, living in much the same fashion as their new neighbours. The Libyans of the south, however, have preserved their traditional nomadic lifestyle, moving along the caravan routes from oasis to oasis. \n\nWhen the first Greek settlers arrived in [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName], relations with the native Libyans were initially remarkably close. After the Greeks had originally settled at [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetName], it was a group of native Libyans who suggested the current location of [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] as a better place to found a city. The Greeks in turn chose the legendary Greek huntress $omen_cyre$ as the patron deity of their city (alongside $omen_apollo$ whose oracle had led them to Cyrenaica). Intermarriage between Libyans and Greeks was common, and many Libyan religious and cultural practices were incorporated into the Cyrenaican culture - first and foremost, the worship of the Libyan ram-headed god $omen_ammon$. Nowhere is this mixing of culture more apparent than in Cyrenaica's second largest city, [GetProvince('(int32)3357').GetName], considered by many to be as much Libyan as it is Greek. \n\nHowever, since the early days of Greek settlement, Libyan-Greek relations have soured considerably. Nomadic Libyan tribes from the south are a constant threat to the Cyrenaican cities, regularly aiding the countryside and occasionally banding together to attack the cities themselves. Relations with the northern Libyans, now a minority in their own lands, are still relatively good, but outside of [GetProvince('(int32)3357').GetName] intermarriage has become rare and Libyans often find themselves pushed to the fringes of society.\n\nNonetheless, the Libyans remain a powerful force within [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName]. Depending on our actions, they might become a mighty ally or a powerful enemy for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s new government."

 cyr_magas_01.14.desc:0 "In order to combat the threat of Libyan raids against our countryside we have intensified patrols along the edge of the desert. A few particularly daring commanders have even launched preemptive attacks against groups of Libyan nomads which they considered suspicious.

The school itself was founded by #Y Aristippus the Elder#! during the time of Socrates, however many of his teaching were formalized only by [GetCharacter('(int32)233').GetName], called 'Metrodidaktos' ('Mother-Taught') since he learned philosophy from his mother Arete, daughter of Aristippus the Elder. \n\nCyrenaicism is a hedonistic school of philosophy that emphasizes individual pleasure as the highest goal of human life. Other values, such as a virtuous life, are only valued to the extent and that they can increase the individual's pleasure or decrease the individual's suffering. \n\nRecently however, the popularity of Cyrenaicism has been in decline, largely due to the rise of new, non-Cyrenaic hedonistic philosophers such as [GetCharacter('(int32)218').GetName] whose ideas are more refined than those of Aristippus. In response, a new generation of Cyrenaic philosophers has emerged who are trying to update the Cyrenaic school to allow it to compete with the other philosophical schools of the day. Of particular note are the teachings of [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName], [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName] and [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetName]. \n\nLike other Cyrenaics [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName] considers pleasure the ultimate goal of life, unlike Aristippus however he believes that pleasure needs to be consider for each action individually (rather than as the total pleasure accrued over one's lifetime), and that suffering is not the opposite of pleasure. Thus, for [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetFirstName], virtues such as friendship, loyalty and patriotism can be good as they bring pleasure in the moment, even if they may occasionally cause pain and suffering in the long run. \n\n[GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName], too, shares the common Cyrenaic belief in pleasure as the ultimate goal of life. However, he openly rejects friendship and patriotism as distractions from the pursuit of happiness, instead insisting that 'the world is his country'. In fact, [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName] believes that there is nothing inherently wrong with crimes such as theft and adultery - they are to be avoided only because the punishments society imposes in return cause suffering (and thus reduce pleasure). However, [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName]'s most controversial claim by far is his insistence that the gods – or at least the commonly accepted gods of the Hellenistic world – are false and that gods, prayer, sacrifices and sacrilege are all just human inventions. His insistance that the gods don't exist has earned [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName] the nickname 'Atheus' ('The Atheist'). \n\n[GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetName] likewise sees happiness as the highest goal of life.

Instead, the followers of [GetCharacter('(int32)218').GetFirstName] live modestly while pursuing the immaterial pleasures derived from friendship, justice and intellectual pursuits. \n\n#Y Stoicism #! emphasises fortitude, self-control and the living of a virtuous life. For the Stoics, happiness is not the goal in life, but rather a natural consequence of life according to the Stoic virtues. To this end, Stoics strive to free themselves from passion, instead responding to everything in live with reason, logic and a calm mind. By following these teachings, the Stoics believe they can avoid suffering - and thus achieve happiness - by recognising the role that painful events play in the natural order of the universe. \n\nFinally, #Y Cynicism #! focuses on the pursuit of a virtuous live by rejecting the artificial conventions of society and living in accordance with the natural order. The Cynics preach poverty and shamelessness, not because they are below shame, but because they consider themselves above material wealth and shamefulness. Accordingly, Cynics live in poverty and don't hesitate to eat, relieve themselves, or engage in intercourse in public, often going out of their way to make their condition as visible as possible in the hope of spreading their philosophy."

# Tasks

 #cyrene_1_magas_DESCRIPTION:0 "The lands of Cyrenaica form an oasis of lush plains and verdant forests amidst the unforgiving sands of the Libyan Desert. \n\nIt was this wealth of resources which three hundred years ago, attracted Greek settlers from the island of Thera who founded the five cities of Cyrenaica; Cyrene, Taucheira, Euesperides, Belagrae and Barce. These five cities gave Cyrenaica its two names, Pentapolis, "The Five Cities", or Cyrenaica, "The Lands of Cyrene", after the most important of the five. The commander of the group that founded Cyrene took the local Libyan name Battus, and his descendants would reign as Kings of Cyrenaica until the Kingdom's fall to the expanding Persian Empire. \n\nUnder the rule of the Battids the young colonies of Colonies of Cyrenaica grew to be one of the most important centres of learning in the Greek world, with its medical school and philosophical academy at times rivaling Athens itself. The flourishing trade with Crete and the Greek cities on the Peleponnese brought with it not only much wealth, but also a growing number of new settlers from all over the Greek world. \n\nSoon however, tensions between the original settlers from Thera, other Greeks, and the local Libyans began to grow. And thus, around the year 200 AUC (~550 BCE) the then king of Cyrenaica, Battus III, in an attempt to stabilise his realm, instituted constitutional reforms which greatly limited the authority of the king in favour of an elected senate. Battus III's heirs greatly resented this move towards republicanism until, following a series of civil wars and the eventual murder of his father Arcesilaus III, the grandson of Battus III, Battus IV, invited in the armies of Persia in order to secure his old rights. \n\nSubmission to the Persians however would not save the Battid dynasty. In the year 313 AUC (440 BCE) Battus IV's successor, Arcesilaus IV, would likewise be murdered by his own citizens, to be replaced this time not by another Battid ruler, but by a governor appointed by the Persian Emperor. \n\nThus the Kingdom of Cyrenaica came to an end, replaced first by Persian rule and then by submission to its conquerors, Alexander the Great and ultimately his successor in Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter. Ptolemy put Cyrenaica into the hands of Ophellas, a veteran of Alexander's Indian campaign. Ophellas however was killed when he was betrayed by his own allies during an invasion of Carthage. The death of Ophellas has left Cyrenaica without an official ruler, formally still part of Egypt but de facto independent.

What little remained of Ophellas's invasion force afterwards switched sides and joined the army of [GetCharacter('(int32)56').GetFirstName]. \n\nAgathocles's betrayal cost Cyrenaica its newly conquered western possessions and threw its government into chaos and civil war.

 cyr_death_by_starvation_desc:0 "The magnum opus of the Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, called 'Peisithanatos' (Death-Persuader) for his ability to drive people to suicide by convincing them that happiness is unattainable and life is not worth living." 
 cyr_on_the_measure_of_the_world:0 "On the Measure of the World"
 cyr_on_the_measure_of_the_world_desc:0 "The magnum opus of Eratosthenes of Cyrene. It describes how he used the lengths of shadows in different locations to accurately calculate the circumference of the world."
 cyr_rock_edict:0 "Rock Edict:0 Mission to Yona"
 cyr_rock_edict_desc:0 "Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule."
 cyr_works_of_kallimakhos:0 "Poetry of Kallimakhos"
 cyr_works_of_kallimakhos_desc:0 "Consisting of over 800 individual pieces of literature, the combined works of the great poet Kallimakhos may be the most influential work of literature of the Hellenistic age. \n\nKallimakhos most important creations are the 'Pinakes' (a comprehensive catalogue of all Greek literature), the 'Aetia' (a series of poems on the mythological origins of reality),  the 'Hecale' (an epic poem about the life of an old women, framed through the eyes of the hero Theseus) as well as his Iambs (satirical poems) and Hymns (a set of 60 religious hymns)."
 cyr_the_last_silphium:0 "The Last Silphium"
 cyr_the_last_silphium_desc:0 "The dried and preserved remains of the last silphium plant ever harvested. Once this medicinal herb was so abundant in Cyrenaica that much of the Cyrenaican economy was built around its export. Now, this small bundle of plant matter is all that remains."
 cyr_control_grazing:0 "#R Silphium #! Control Livestock Grazing"
 cyr_control_grazing_desc:0 "Part of the reason for the decline in the silphium harvest is the growing number of livestock, especially cattle, grazing in Cyrenaica. The herds of livestock eat many silphium plants before they can reproduce. \n\nIf we want to secure the silphium supply we will need to control the amount of cattle that is allowed to graze in Cyrenaica."
 cyr_control_exports:0 "#R Silphium #! Limit Silphium Export"
 cyr_control_exports_desc:0 "The biggest contributor to the decline of silphium is our own uncontrolled, export of the plant. Enforcing strict export limits will not be popular, but it is a necessity if we want to give the silphium population time to recover."
 cyr_stabilise_silphium:0 "#R Silphium #! Stabilise Silphium Exploitation"
 cyr_stabilise_silphium_desc:0 "Due to timely action by our government, the silphium harvest has been stabilised at a sustainable level. While this a bit of a step backwards compared with the phenomenal wealth that the silphium trade used to bring to our country, it guarantees that the people of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] will be able to profit from the gift of Apollo for generations to come.

 cyr_wooing_DEL_insult:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Diplomatic Insult"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_insult_desc:0 "The viscous diplomatic insult we recently inflicted upon [GetCountry('PRY').GetName] has had its intended effect:0 [GetCountry('PRY').GetRuler.GetName]'s inability to mount a decisive response has made him look weak in the eyes of his subjects.

 cyr_wooing_DEL_piracy:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Rooting out Piracy"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_piracy_desc:0 "Pirates are the scourge of the Aegean Sea, which is why rooting them out is one of the key mission of the [GetCountry('CYR').GetAdjective] navy. It appears that this investment into maritime security has not gone unnoticed by the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName], who now rely heavily on our help to keep their coastal waters safe. This will draw the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] closer to our sphere of influence."
 cyr_wooing_DEL_fleet:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! A Large War Fleet"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_fleet_desc:0 "As a collection of small islands, the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] relies heavily on the sea for its survival. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the whoever controls the sea controls the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName]. We now possess a fleet large enough to contest the waters of the Aegean against almost any foe. This will draw the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] closer to our sphere of influence."
 cyr_wooing_DEL_eclipsing_fleet:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Eclipsing Naval Power"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_eclipsing_fleet_desc:0 "The [GetCountry('CYR').GetAdjective] fleet is now considerably larger than the fleet of the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName]'s overlord, [GetCountry('PRY').GetName]. Without a powerful fleet [GetCountry('PRY').GetName] will find it very hard to continue exerting influence over the Aegean Islands. This will draw the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] closer to our sphere of influence."
 cyr_wooing_DEL_eclipsing_PRY:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Eclipsing the Antigonids"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_eclipsing_PRY_desc:0 "[GetCountry('PRY').GetName] is small and weak.

 cyr_wooing_DEL_liberation:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Liberation"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_liberation_desc:0 "Our recent liberation of [cyr_wooing_DEL_liberated_country_scope.GetName] from foreign oppression has firmly established [GetCountry('CYR').GetName] as a friend of the small city states of Hellas and beyond. This makes us considerably more appealing as potential ally for the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] since they can be confident that their rights will be protected under our rule. This will draw the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] closer to our sphere of influence."
 cyr_wooing_DEL_games:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Sponsoring Public Games"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_games_desc:0 "Maybe the most visible sign of  [GetCountry('PRY').GetAdjective] authority over the [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] are the annual games taking place in [GetCountry('DEL').GetCapital.GetName] in honour of the [GetCountry('PRY').GetAdjective] ruling family. If we were to sponsor our own games to rival the [GetCountry('PRY').GetAdjective] ones, it would certainly undermine [GetCountry('PRY').GetAdjective] rule greatly."
 cyr_wooing_DEL_demand_loyalty:0 "#R Nesiotic League #! Demand Loyalty"
 cyr_wooing_DEL_demand_loyalty_desc:0 "The time has come to demand that [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] accept us as their new overlord. If they accept [GetCountry('DEL').GetName] will cease to be a subject of [GetCountry('PRY').GetName] and become part of our sphere of influence."

 battiad_desc:0 "Battus I was the leader of the first Greeks to settle in Cyrenaica. Originally a noble called Aristotle or Aristaeus, he took the name 'Battus' - meaning 'King' in the native Libyan tongue - after a prophecy by the Oracle of Delphi instructed him to found a colony in Libya. Battus's colony would become the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName], and Battus the first king of Cyrenaica. \n\nThe descendants of Battus would continue to rule as kings of Cyrenaica for 200 years, until the integration of Cyrenaica into the Persian Empire. Battiad rule was characterised by unusually good relations between Greek settlers and native Libyans, as well as by the Battiads's generous support for philosophy and learning."
 magas:0 "Blood of Magas and Berenike"
 magas_desc:0 "Berenike was a high ranking Macedonian noblewomen. She was the grand-niece of the former regent of [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetFirstName]'s empire, [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] and a distant relative of [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetName] himself. \n\nAfter the death of her first husband, Philip, she moved to Egypt to join the court of her relative, [GetCharacter('(int32)29').GetName] who was the wife of the Egyptian king [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName]. Once at the Egyptian court, Berenike quickly replaced [GetCharacter('(int32)29').GetFirstName] as [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetFirstName]'s wife, becoming the de facto queen of Egypt and ensuring that her first son with [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetFirstName], [GetCharacter('(int32)45').GetName], would succeed [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetFirstName] as king of Egypt. \n\nBerenike would use her influence to place the children from her first marriage in important positions. Her first born son [GetCharacter('(int32)46').GetName] would become the king of Cyrenaica, while her daughters [GetCharacter('(int32)115').GetFirstName] and [GetCharacter('(int32)57').GetFirstName] would marry [GetCharacter('(int32)70').GetName], king of Epirus, and [GetCharacter('(int32)56').GetName], the tyrant of Sicily, respectively."
