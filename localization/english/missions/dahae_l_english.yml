 me_dahae.1.desc: "With the clan leaders now present, we must ask a fundamental question - how should we approach question of expansion?

 me_dahae.4.desc: "Steppe horses @steppe_horses! are famed for their size and tameness, and traders from all across the world travel to our markets in hopes of procuring these mighty beasts for their own purposes. It is known far and wide that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has the best steppe horses available anywehere, and we are fortunate to say that we have entire herds of these precious animals at our disposal.\n\nAs such, with this many horses prepared, it is only fitting to train and utilize them in a manner we see fit. Our horse masters have asked [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to decide how our animals are to be trained; should they focus on attacking our foes or defending our battle formations?"

 me_dahae.7.t: "Steppe Falconry - Beginning"
 me_dahae.7.desc: "Hunting with falcons is one of the greatest pleasures enjoyed by a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warrior, aside from proving their worth in combat. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to host such a challenge in order to raise our diplomatic standing with the other Tribal Chieftains. And if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] manages to win this event, then the fame of our Chieftain will spread far and wide - a boon to the tribesmen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_dahae.7.a: "Let us organize the greatest falconry challenge!"

 me_dahae.8.t: "Steppe Falconry - Invitations"
 me_dahae.8.desc: "Before we embark on the falcon hunt, we obviously need to send out invitations. How much effort should we put into it? It is widely known that offering a small gift alongside our request will make it harder to decline, but it all depends on if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] feels like dipping into the treasury."
 me_dahae.8.a: "Send regular invitations"
 me_dahae.8.b: "Send invitations with gifts"

 me_dahae.9001.t: "Steppe Falconry - Failure"
 me_dahae.9001.desc: "Well, it seems that nobody was interested in showing up for the falcon hunt. The excuses offered to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] were pathetic and our kinsmen are laughing at our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] behind [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] back. We might want to rethink if diplomacy is an option here then."
 me_dahae.9001.a: "This is embarassing..."
 me_dahae.9001.a.tt: "The #Y Falcon Hunt#! will be #R Cancelled#!."
 me_dahae.9002.t: "Steppe Falconry - Guests Arrive"
 me_dahae.9002.desc: "Oh, what a delight to see everyone gathered and united in love of kumis and hunting. All that is left is to entertain the crowd, which should pay dividends down the line."

 me_dahae.1001.desc: "Over the last couple of days, [attendee_1.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] became good buddies with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], participating in diplomacy at its best. The two are often seen walking together, swapping war stories and laughing at each other's jokes, and both leaders have been toasting each other's health with fermented mare's milk whenever the occasion arises."
 me_dahae.1001.a: "Let's raise our cups of delicious Kumis!"
 me_dahae.1002.t: "Steppe Falconry - Unfortunate Joke"
 me_dahae.1002.desc: "There was an incident this morning that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would like to forget as soon as possible; when everyone was listening to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] made a joke that didn't quite land with the audience. Other leaders have enough tact to not be too offended, but this does not improve our standing among them regardless."
 me_dahae.1002.a: "Well, this is embarassing..."

 me_dahae.11.t: "Steppe Falconry - Moving Forward"
 me_dahae.11.desc: "The time has now arrived to leave the comfort of the camp and start the thing everyone's been waiting for; the #E Falcon Hunt#!.

They say [heir_scope.GetName] was found by their horse, in a small clearing with a few scattered trees - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] knows the place that they speak of. In death, [heir_scope.GetFirstName]'s face is calm, almost serene, and the devastated [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] reached out a trembling hand to caress [heir_scope.GetHerHis] pale brow.\n\nAll at once, the terrible reality of the situation dawned on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] began to weep silently.\n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"

 me_dahae.1303.t: "Steppe Falconry - Poachers"
 me_dahae.1303.desc: "A bit of bad news breaks the morning's silence; while creeping through the tall grass, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] found some poachers; vile criminals that go against the laws of the steppe. These hunting grounds are known to be a sacred place, set aside for the use of the Tribal Chieftains, and our kinsmen know better than to scour these territories in hopes of finding prey. A punishment must be doled out at once.\n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"

 me_dahae.1305.a: "Send the falcon out with prayers for success!"
 me_dahae.1305.tt:0 "The outcome depends on sum of martial@military_icon! and finesse@civic_icon! skills of your Ruler."
 me_dahae.1305.b: "We should focus on tracking instead of pursuing vainglory"

 me_dahae.1307.t: "Steppe Falconry - Peacocking"
 me_dahae.1307.desc: "As the hunting party fords a small river, other participants on the hunt want to show off their skills and have called for a momentary diversion; typical grandstanding from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors, who are constantly trying to outdo each other in feats of glory. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can't afford to lose; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] must win this test or be humiliated before everyone. The goal is to have a falcon snatch a fish from the rushing waters. \n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"
 me_dahae.1307.a: "Send my bird out to hunt it"
 me_dahae.1307.tt:0 "Outcome depends on sum of charisma@oratory_icon! and zeal@religious_icon! skills of your ruler."
 me_dahae.1307.b: "Try to grab the fish yourself"

 me_dahae.1308.t: "Steppe Falconry - Bird Wants To Fly"
 me_dahae.1308.desc: "The skies are overcast and a quick-moving storm is threatening to unleash its fury upon the hunting party. It is kind of an unfit moment for letting your bird out, but it seems to be restless and is constantly cawing. If the falcon doesn't find anything, it could be damaging to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s' reputation. Should [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] release it? \n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"

 me_dahae.1309.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s falcon has found a tall tree and is settling itself down in its highest branches, and nothing is convincing the bird to return to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s arm; not even gifts of dried meat can convince the foolish animal. Everyone is laughing at the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] misbehaving pet, causing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s cheeks to turn bright red.\n\nIf [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] tries to grab the falcon from its perch and fails, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will look like a fool, but leaving the bird alone will damage the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]'s reputation. \n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"

 me_dahae.1601.t: "Steppe Falconry - Results"
 me_dahae.1601.desc: "The #E Falcon Hunt#! has drawn to its conclusion, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s bird managed to capture a great hawk, an animal is sacred to our people! The feisty falcon of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] somehow killed a bird twice its size and brought its carcass to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], sendling ripples of appreciation throughout the gathered host. This hunt will surely be remembered by all."

 me_dahae.1601.a.t: "The #Y Falcon Hunt#! ends."

 me_dahae.1602.t: "Steppe Falconry - Results"
 me_dahae.1602.desc: "Despite riding through the steppe for hours and sending the falcon out a half-dozen times, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] failed in catching any prey. Some of the warband claimed that this lack of success was an evil omen, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] dismissed this as idle talk and told everyone that it was time to return to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."

 me_dahae.1901.t: "The Steppe Summit - Failure"
 me_dahae.1901.desc: "Well, it seems diplomacy failed and no one outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] wants a united and strong #E Dahae Confederacy#!...so now it is up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to make sure that this intiative comes to pass."

 me_dahae.1902.desc: "Now that the gathered hosts have assembled in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to discuss our future together, the first discussion is centered on the issue of whether or not our levies should train together. This will also increase feeling of brotherhood between the tribes, but there are those that believe this is a ploy by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to seize control of the levies for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self."

 me_dahae.2000.desc: "The first order of business is a simple one, but our decision will have important ramifications for the future. Should we agree to common training with the other #E Dahae#! tribes?"
