 me_dahae.1.desc:0 "With the clan leaders now present, we must ask a fundamental question - how should we approach question of expansion?

 me_dahae.4.desc:0 "Steppe horses @steppe_horses! are famed for their size and tameness, and traders from all across the world travel to our markets in hopes of procuring these mighty beasts for their own purposes. It is known far and wide that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has the best steppe horses available anywehere, and we are fortunate to say that we have entire herds of these precious animals at our disposal.\n\nAs such, with this many horses prepared, it is only fitting to train and utilize them in a manner we see fit. Our horse masters have asked [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to decide how our animals are to be trained; should they focus on attacking our foes or defending our battle formations?"

 me_dahae.7.t:0 "Steppe Falconry - Beginning"

And if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] manages to win this event, then the fame of our Chieftain will spread far and wide - a boon to the tribesmen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 me_dahae.8.t:0 "Steppe Falconry - Invitations"
 me_dahae.8.desc:0 "Before we embark on the falcon hunt, we obviously need to send out invitations. How much effort should we put into it? It is widely known that offering a small gift alongside our request will make it harder to decline, but it all depends on if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] feels like dipping into the treasury."
 me_dahae.8.a:0 "Send regular invitations"
 me_dahae.8.b:0 "Send invitations with gifts"

 me_dahae.9001.desc:0 "Well, it seems that nobody was interested in showing up for the falcon hunt. The excuses offered to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] were pathetic and our kinsmen are laughing at our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] behind [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] back.

 me_dahae.1001.desc:0 "Over the last couple of days, [attendee_1.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] became good buddies with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], participating in diplomacy at its best. The two are often seen walking together, swapping war stories and laughing at each other's jokes, and both leaders have been toasting each other's health with fermented mare's milk whenever the occasion arises."

Other leaders have enough tact to not be too offended, but this does not improve our standing among them regardless."
 me_dahae.1002.a:0 "Well, this is embarassing..."

 me_dahae.11.t:0 "Steppe Falconry - Moving Forward"
 me_dahae.11.desc:0 "The time has now arrived to leave the comfort of the camp and start the thing everyone's been waiting for; the #E Falcon Hunt#!.

 me_dahae.1303.desc:0 "A bit of bad news breaks the morning's silence; while creeping through the tall grass, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] found some poachers; vile criminals that go against the laws of the steppe. These hunting grounds are known to be a sacred place, set aside for the use of the Tribal Chieftains, and our kinsmen know better than to scour these territories in hopes of finding prey. A punishment must be doled out at once.\n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"

 me_dahae.1307.desc:0 "As the hunting party fords a small river, other participants on the hunt want to show off their skills and have called for a momentary diversion; typical grandstanding from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors, who are constantly trying to outdo each other in feats of glory. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can't afford to lose; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] must win this test or be humiliated before everyone. The goal is to have a falcon snatch a fish from the rushing waters. \n\nOur current success chance: #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.MakeScope.GetVariable('dahae_hunt_success_chance').GetValue|0]%#!"
 me_dahae.1307.a:0 "Send my bird out to hunt it"
