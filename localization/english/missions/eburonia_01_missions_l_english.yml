 eburonian_missions_01: "Bravest of the Gauls!"
 eburonian_missions_01_DESCRIPTION: "In the northern region of Gaul, far from the soft, civilized lands of the Mediterranean, live the fierce Belgae. They are surrounded by enemy tribes; the dreaded Germans to the east often cross the Rhenus River to attack, and the Gauls to the west are no friends of the Belgae, but rivals for power.\n\nAs wars of unification spread throughout the south, with Kings and Generals struggling as they hope to piece together a sundered Empire, so, too, do the Belgians fight to create their nation - only time will tell who can claim to be the bravest of the Gauls."
 eburonian_missions_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when Eburonia has conquered her Belgic rivals and established a mighty kingdom in the north."
 eburonian_missions_01_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "'Of all the Gauls, the strongest are the Belgians because of their distance from our provinces.'- Julius Caesar"

 eburonian_missions_task_10: "Bravest Of The Belgae"
 eburonian_missions_task_10_DESC: "It is true that our people love war and the accolades earned in battle - nothing makes the Eburones happier than hearing a story about the brave deeds of her warriors.\n\nThis extends to the private life of her leaders, as well; a Tribal Chieftain must not be afraid to strike down enemies wherever they are, even in personal combat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

 eburonian_missions_task_13: "Harenatium On The Rhenus"
 eburonian_missions_task_13_DESC: "Although we have abandoned our former capital for a new, planned city on the coast, it does not mean that [GetProvince('(int32)3712').GetName] has become a backwater; quite the opposite, in fact.
