After countless years of being a federated tribe, it has been decided to reward [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who is most responsible for our current state of affairs, with the crown. No more shall we be ruled by councils of magistrates and elders, but we shall finally have a true sovereign to guide us.\n\nNo expense was spared for the coronation ceremony, as the finest wines and luxury foods were imported from abroad, supplementing the traditional dishes of our people. Borne on a litter of silver and ivory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was paraded through the streets of [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], showering gifts of golden coins upon the gathered crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal procession.

 me_fezzani_5_desc: "For weeks now, the only sounds that could be heard throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] were the cries of laborers working in the streets. One by one, the stones were laid upon each other and the streets were widened, and permanent structures of brick replaced ramshackle buildings of wood and mud.\n\nAlthough the effort has been tremendous, the backs of our people are stronger and we have build a magnificent city that would be unrecognizable to our forebears."

The red and green varieties of date are the sweetest, and you can only find them in the markets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] - a town that is known for the many varieties of confectionaries made with the abundance of dates found in the country.\n\nThe ubiquitous nature of the date in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society has resulted in a delicious dilemma, forcing our chefs to find creative ways to use the surplus.

Thankfully for us, the trade routes that the Psyllians once used are well-known to the locals, who have promised to resume business under our watchful eye.

Such impressive outbursts are the reason that some of the locals have given [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] an archaic title, #E 'Ar'uz-Ona'#!, which means 'master poet' in a nearly forgotten dialect of Old [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]."

 me_fezzani_405_desc: "Because we have spent vast sums building up the lands that border those of the #E Psyllians#!, it has been suggested, albeit tongue-in-cheek, that we prepare claims on their territories and join them with ours. We can't afford to have a hostile neighbor enviously eyeing up our properties, after all."
 me_fezzani_405.a: "There isn't enough room for us and them..."
 me_fezzani_406_title: "The Nasamonian Lands"
 me_fezzani_406_desc: "Those greedy #E Nasamonians#!, never content with what the gods have given to them, are now apparently casting their hungry eyes into our realm, questioning if we are able to defend those things that they covet.\n\nNever one to wait for the other sandal to drop, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is prepared to meet violence with violence and has claimed the homelands of the would-be invaders."
 me_fezzani_406.a: "Be careful what you wish for, lest you lose it all"
 me_fezzani_407_title: "The Desert Demons"
 me_fezzani_407_desc: "At long last, the hour that many feared is at hand; war between the mighty #E Garamantes#! and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] hordes is upon us. A conflict of this magnitude will involve everyone in the region; there can be no neutrality in matters of life and death.\n\nEven now, our forces brace themselves for the initial skirmishes with their arch-rivals...there will only be one standing when all is said and done!"
 me_fezzani_407.a: "May the gods of war and death grant us victory!"
 me_fezzani_408_title: "The Machylians"
 me_fezzani_408_desc: "As was predicted by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the #E Machylians#! have been able to determine which way the desert winds are blowing and have wisely decided to seek shelter from the sun under the shade that we can provide to them - good!"
 me_fezzani_408.a: "We never doubted their sagacity"
 me_fezzani_409_title: "The Machylians"
 me_fezzani_409_desc: "The diplomats have been sent, and the reply has returned with our wandering ambassadors - for better or for worse, the #E Machylians#! have made their choice clear, and now we await the reactions in the capitals of our enemies."
 me_fezzani_409.a: "This could be the beginning of a long, long friendship"
 me_fezzani_409.b: "Let's hope the 'wise' Machylians don't regret their actions!"

 me_fezzani_501_title: "The Pheasants"
 me_fezzani_501_desc: "Even though we are a small tribe, surrounded by larger, more aggressive enemies, all is not lost.\n\nAs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is often fond of saying, 'Consider the pheasant - most beautiful of all birds flying through our deserts. Even though it is a delicate creature, its majestic nature captivates all that witness it. We, too, are like the pheasant."
 me_fezzani_501.a: "From humble beginnings, all manner of things are possible"
 me_fezzani_502_title: "A Desert Oasis"
 me_fezzani_502_desc: "At long last, the construction work in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has drawn to its conclusion, and our proud [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] engineers are eager to show off all of their hard work.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], pleased with their efforts to build a modern capital, envisions a future where our tax incomes are more numerous than the grains of sand in the desert."
 me_fezzani_502.a: "We will be wealthy beyond our wildest dreams one day"
 me_fezzani_503_title: "The Makae"
 me_fezzani_503_desc: "What once seemed unthinkable a few short years ago is now the reality; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is addressing our troops, who are gathering en masse near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for the purported invasion of #E Makae#!.\n\nWithin a few weeks, their borderlands will be seized by our levies, and then we shall meet their men in battle and spill their blood into the desert sands."
 me_fezzani_503.a: "Fly, my pheasants, and destroy those who oppose us!"
 me_fezzani_504_title: "An Alliance Network"
 me_fezzani_504_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is no fool, and having taken stock of our military preparedness, is very worried about the possibility of an attack by #E Carthage#!, the tyrant to our north.\n\nThe Carthaginians are more than happy to prey upon the divided tribes, gobbling them up one at a time, so hopefully our neighbors have noticed this happening and are willing to join their strength to ours in case war finds us."
 me_fezzani_504.a: "Send the envoys out at once"
 me_fezzani_505_title: "The Psyllia"
 me_fezzani_505_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made it abundantly clear that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] desires the harbors, and especially the shipyards, of #E Psyllia#! - even though our people have been bound to the deserts for centuries, the promise of building our own armadas to sail the waters of the Mediterranean are proving a temptation that the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are having a hard time resisting."
 me_fezzani_505.a: "I want those ports for myself...we have work to do"
 me_fezzani_506_title: "The Eastern Fezzani Tribes"
 me_fezzani_506_desc: "If we have hopes of forming a new kingdom, one that incorporates all of the rowdy desert tribes underneath of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] banner, then we must send our men deep into the eastern deserts where the scattered forces of our defeated enemies are preparing to make their last stand.\n\nThey are foolishly placing their hopes in a general that has promised to tear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] down, stone by stone."
 me_fezzani_506.a: "We shall spare them no mercy! March forth!"
 me_fezzani_507_title: "The Last Tribe"
 me_fezzani_507_desc: "Although no one could have predicted this, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has privately lamented the news that the #E Garamantes#!, our ancient and mortal enemies, have been utterly destroyed. When questioned, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] wistfully recalls a time when the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] knew the Garamantic tribes intimately, and even though we did not see eye to eye all of the time, we considered them blood relations, sharers in our way of life.\n\nBut the last tribe of Garamantia has been destroyed forever, and the future remains unknowable..."
 me_fezzani_507.a: "We shall miss you, old foe..."
 me_fezzani_508_title: "Our Alliance Network"
 me_fezzani_508_desc: "Fabulous news from the north! Our neighbors, the #E Gyzantians#!, have answered our call with a pledge to help against Carthaginian aggression.\n\nIt seems that they are just as concerned as we are about Punic expansion and want to make sure we hold the forces of #E Qart Hadasht#! at bay."
 me_fezzani_508.a: "We are stronger when we work together"
 me_fezzani_509_title: "Our Alliance Network"
 me_fezzani_509_desc: "You might not believe this, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but our diplomats assure us that every word they say is true.\n\nOnce they heard that we were actively building a coalition against them, the #E Carthaginians#! have sent us assurances of their good intentions. They claim they are more interested in expanding in #E Iberia#! than our deserts, and as a token of their goodwill, have agreed to become our allies! They hope that this will assuage our fears of a Punic invasion."
 me_fezzani_509.a: "This was very unexpected..."
 me_fezzani_510_title: "Our Alliance Network"
 me_fezzani_510_desc: "Our ambassadors have been sent out, and we will soon have our answers; as frustrating as it is, we must wait for our diplomats to do their work and hopefully bring us good news. "
 me_fezzani_510.a: "The hour of battle could soon be upon us - will we be alone?"
