We learned so much from them in such a short time.\n\nRecently, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had a brilliant idea - the time has come for us to send our own expeditions out into the world and to return the favor once bestowed upon us. What will be discovered in the vast unknown? Golden cities? Huge animals? Perhaps the very gods themselves? Nobody knows yet, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is eager to find out.\n\nA few rational voices from the Council of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have objected, however, saying that they would rather spend the money set aside for this expedition on improving the lives of our citizens back home.

Anything and everything that one could ever want is found here in Rome, and our men are tempted by a thousand different activities, each one sounding better than the last.\nThe markets of Rome are known for their rare treasures and goods - is that where we shall spend our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] coin? We were also advised to visit the temples and pay respects to the gods, so should we go there?

After inquiries are made, it appears that these architects would sell their blueprints to us - maybe a Roman villa in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] would be good?\n\nThe neighing of a stallion breaks this daydream.

The Captain announces that we will stay to observe the Roman rites, and a small cheer goes through the crowd.\n\nBut someone comes close, an old man with a running nose, and snorts loudly and dismissively.

The roads are sound, well-constructed, and soldiers patrol them regularly, ready to protect merchants and travelers. In the distance, a large estate can be seen, and hundreds of slaves are working in the vineyards surrounding the latifundia.\n\nTurning from this scene, one of the soldiers remarks 'Farms and fields are good, but a warrior prefers roads - they are good for the army and good for my feet.'

Debates can be watched from the public bench, however, and our men take their seats but are soon confused by the legal machinations on display.

We can try to visit the tomb of the great Macedonian. Some of our men have asked that we travel south to see the pyramids, as we are as close to the ancient monuments as we will ever be. And while these cultural attractions have their merits, the glimmer of sunlight reflected off silver shields has also caught the eye of our soldiers - there are Egyptian warriors training outside of the city."

And yet, there is a seedy underbelly to the market, as slave traders are always there - it is a pitiful sight to see a naked slave sitting on a mat with a heavy chain around its neck.
