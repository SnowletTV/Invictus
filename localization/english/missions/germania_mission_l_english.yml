Also, it would not be wise to transform all your lands into a zoo filled with elephant and bees!\n\nThat is why, for the success of installation of these new goods, we will limit the production of each to #G 2 territories#! on our island; the people would not like if we disturb their traditional land too much.\n\nFaced with dazzling temptations, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] will have to decide what to buy before the departure of the trader."
