 getae_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "Our people, the settled tribes of the #E Getae#!, inhabit the wooded hills that sweep south of the #E Carpathian Mountains#! to our north, and our dominion ends where the mighty waters of the #E River Ister#! separate us from the #E Thracians#! that live on its southern shores.\n\nAlthough we are far removed from the conflicts that are tearing apart Asia, times are changing for us, as well; the eastern coastal cities are swelling with #E Greek#! colonists that are casting a hungry eye on our territories, and there are fierce barbarians around us that would not hesitate to seize our homes if our guard should fall. We have only lived free for a couple of generations and will not allow anyone to rule over us again.\n\nThere are many impediments standing in our way, and yet our destiny calls us all the louder for it - we must rise above it all and unite the #E Dacians#! under one sword, becoming a shield against any that would stand against us."
 getae_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have formed the nation of #E Dacia#! and have built a capital city worthy of the name."
