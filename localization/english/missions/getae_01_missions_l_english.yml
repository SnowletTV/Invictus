 getae_mission_01_inv: "Sword And Shield Of The Dacians"
 getae_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION: "Our people, the settled tribes of the #E Getae#!, inhabit the wooded hills that sweep south of the #E Carpathian Mountains#! to our north, and our dominion ends where the mighty waters of the #E River Ister#! separate us from the #E Thracians#! that live on its southern shores.\n\nAlthough we are far removed from the conflicts that are tearing apart Asia, times are changing for us, as well; the eastern coastal cities are swelling with #E Greek#! colonists that are casting a hungry eye on our territories, and there are fierce barbarians around us that would not hesitate to seize our homes if our guard should fall. We have only lived free for a couple of generations and will not allow anyone to rule over us again.\n\nThere are many impediments standing in our way, and yet our destiny calls us all the louder for it - we must rise above it all and unite the #E Dacians#! under one sword, becoming a shield against any that would stand against us."
 getae_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when we have formed the nation of #E Dacia#! and have built a capital city worthy of the name."
 getae_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "No one shall stand in the way of our dream - the formation of mighty #E Dacia#!..."

Claiming that these fortified trading cities represent an existential threat to the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetFirstName] has been pressing for a military campaign that will see our forces conquering the coasts. There is much plunder to be taken, after all, and many heads nod in agreemeent when this point is made.\n\nOf course, there is no universal consensus. [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] believes that a policy of coexistence is the wisest course of action, asking if we can afford to anger the #E Thracians#!, who could easily smash our forces if they had the political will to do so. Instead of gathering our levies, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] is asking [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to prepare a grand diplomatic gesture, one that will captivate the hearts of the Greeks and show them that we are reliable partners in this region. There is much that we could learn from them!\n\nThe arguments between the Chieftains remained cordial, but the underlying tension between the two shows how contentious this issue is.

Finally convinced in the soundness of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] military, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] decided that our forces would move overland, avoiding the unnecessary danger of transporting our troops across the #E River Ister#!.\n\nAfter consulting our maps, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] argued that we should march our forces to the east. The only 'complication', as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] described it, was that this course of action would bring us into conflict with the #E Carpians#!, who had constructed impressive fortifications on our border.\n\nComplaining that the fortress of [GetProvince('(int32)4800').GetName] would be painful for our men to take, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetName] then suggested that we simultaneously prepare claims to the south - there is a natural river crossing near [GetProvince('(int32)4809').GetName] that could take our forces into the province of #E Crobyzoia#!, which is less defended.\n\nThis 'southern strategy' has its detractors, however; [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] especially is claiming that this is a frivolous expense that will stretch our resources when we need them the most."
