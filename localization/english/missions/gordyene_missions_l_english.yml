01_gordyene: "Land of the Karduchoi"
01_gordyene_DESCRIPTION: "The Karduchoi people, with their homeland known by many names over the centuries, including the name 'Qardu,' existed in history as an outlier and a seemingly predatory tribe which both ranged along the so-called Gordyaean Mountains as well as along the left bank of the Tigris herself. \n\nTheir home was naturally gifted, yet dangerous, and was said to have swallowed entire armies in days. A peculiar people, they were both expert combatants and creators, fine-tuned to the wealth of trade which connected at choke points and easier crossings along the river. For these reasons, they were coveted by many empires, but truly 'controlled' by none. They did pay tribute to some, such as the Assyrians and the Armenians, but were often equally bought off by their assumed overlords. Their destiny is to overcome the continental slog-match between Imperial Hellenic powers and to make their way onto the world stage as a unique power-broker in the Mesopotamian realm."
01_gordyene_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when Gordyene has freed herself of her political shackles and the warriors of the Qardu have established a prosperous and long-lasting kingdom ruling over the northern stretches of the Tigris River." 
01_gordyene_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Thus begins the movement of mountains: fearsome, timeless, and unconquerable."

#Missions

01_gordyene_task_1: "An Unruly People"
01_gordyene_task_1_DESC: "Though the Armenians have, in the past, held sway over us in the north, their time is not now. Our tribute to them is not a pleasure, but an annoyance. We call the mountains home - how shall they prosper if we close off the Bitliss pass and refuse to remain their puppets?"
01_gordyene_mission_task_1_tooltip: "The people of #Y Gordyene#! will break away from #E Armenian#! control by means of #R war#!!"

01_gordyene_task_2: "Fortifying the Mountains of Qardu"
01_gordyene_task_2_DESC: "Our lands are the mountain passes. To our northwest lies Mt. Masion, and to the northeast Mt. Niphates, where the ark of the animals is said to remain. Our importance in the region and our control of the regional trade routes depend on our ability to defend the pases and Tigris river crossings. We must thoroughly fortify these lines of communication in order to maintain and grow our position." 

01_gordyene_task_3: "Raiding the Seleukids"
01_gordyene_task_3_DESC: "At war with the other diadochi and spread thin battling rebellious vassals and dangerous neighbors, the Seleukids are vulnerable. The time is now to challenge their authoritiy over the Upper Tigris region. The Karduchoi can begin with border-raids and then the assault on the hinterland can begin..."
01_gordyene_mission_task_3_a_tooltip: "Your #Y Warchief#! must have at least #Y 3#! holdings, be a #Y friend#! of your #Y current ruler#! and must be a member of the #Y ruling family#!." # Can't get scoped peoples's names to work !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
01_gordyene_mission_task_3_b_tooltip: "The warriors of #Y Gordyene#! will assault the #Y Seleukid Empire's#! #E Upper Mesopotamia#! province in a surprise #R war#!!." 

01_gordyene_task_4: "Consolidating the Upper Tigris"
01_gordyene_task_4_DESC: "Running south along the many branches of the Tauros Mountains, the lands of the Upper Tigris are richer and more fertile than the upper reaches of the Euphrates to its south. The trade routes which run through this area bring wealth and vibrancy to its people. Civilizations of old have been born and raised here. The Karduchoi of Qardu have previously explored and, at times, controlled patches of this area, but never all at once. Now the people can thrive and build up the land's potential." 
01_gordyene_task_4_tt:0 "The area of [GetProvince('(int32)833').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] has at least #Y 3#! cities."

01_gordyene_task_5: "A Rival in Adiabene"
01_gordyene_task_5_DESC: "To the southeast, the kingdom state of Adiabene has always proven a threat to us. Their border is close to our southern pasture fields, and there have been several disputes between neighboring shepherds over whose herd should roam which hills. Due to our...rebellious...nature, they have often asked the regional overlords: the Achaemenids, and now the Seleukids, if they could assist in conquering our home. We must end their threat before they can act upon this desire."
01_gordyene_task_5_tt:0 "[GetCountry('ADI').GetName] have at least #G +75#! opinion of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] and [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is friends with [GetCountry('ADI').GetRuler.GetName]."

01_gordyene_mission_task_5_tooltip: "Depending on #Y Gordyene's#! #E relationship#! with #Y Adiabene#!, #G friendly relations#! or #R conflict#! might result..."

01_gordyene_task_6: "Kingdom of Gordyene"
01_gordyene_task_6_DESC: "If the Karduchoi are to survive as a people in this ever-evolving world, then our lands and our lads must be joined together in a kingdom of the people. Our most powerful leader, he of the greatest tribe, shall sally forth and herald a new age - that of the Kingdom of Gordyene."

01_gordyene_task_7: "A Hurrian Kingdom"
01_gordyene_task_7_DESC: "The oldest of our tribes know of places where ancient bones stur, where the ruins of ancient temples stand. There are still those few hermits, reclusive men and women who mutter spells and curses under their breath in the silence of mountain peaks and cavern chambers. Yet, we should not look upon them with confusion or disdain. Theirs was a world of power, so the stories say. Perhaps there is a greater benefit to be had from learning their ways and renewing that which once was in these lands..."

01_gordyene_task_8: "The Triple-Citadel City"
01_gordyene_task_8_DESC: "The capital of Pinaka has already slowly developed into a wealthy place, sitting at a natural junction and crossing on the Tigris river. Three heights exist in the city - 2 on the west bank, and 1 on the east bank. Together, these places provide the perfect defensible positions from which to protect and survey the economic and military efforts along the river's stretch. It will also be enviously eyed, and must be protected at all costs."
01_gordyene_mission_task_7_tooltip: "The #Y Karduchoi#! will be able to #G revive#! the ancient #E Hurrian Religion#!."

01_gordyene_task_9: "The Master-Builders"
01_gordyene_task_9_DESC: "In their mountain workshops, the builders of Qardu have long crafted both strong and creative devices as well as masterful structures. It is no wonder that, despite their decentralized nature, the people of Qardu built so many successful forts, settlements, and cities. Given their prestige, it would be a waste to not set them to work improving the infrastructure and defense of the people."

01_gordyene_task_10: "Sareisa and Satalka"
01_gordyene_task_10_DESC: "Many medium-sized settlements have long awaited a small influx of people to lead to prosperous cities. Because the economy of Qardu relies on both the trade along the Tigris and the rich raw materials of the mountains, the sites of Saraeisa and Satalka beg for improvement and success."

01_gordyene_task_21: "Crossroads of the Tigris"
01_gordyene_task_21_DESC: "The course of the Tigris river drives the trade in the region of Mesopotamia in the north. Caravans and merchants must cross the Tigris at critical points. The lands of Qardu contains some of the greatest and calmest points of crossing, as even Alexander the Great himself discovered on his way to Gaugamela. The opportunities for trade routes and benefits must be exploited." 
gordyene_mission_01_task_21_custom_tooltip:0 "The province of #Y $corduene_area$#! has at least #Y [SCOPE.ScriptValue('gordyene_mission_01_task_21_money_total')|0]#! province income@income! [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.Custom('gordyene_mission_01_task_21_money_loc')]."

01_gordyene_task_12: "Karduchian Pasturelands"
01_gordyene_task_12_DESC: "For all the time that our collective memory holds, our people have mostly been mobile herders, setting our animals to pasture on the rich hills east of the Tigris and in the mountains south of the Armenian range. To both appease our tribal folk and to increase our natural wealth, we ought to improve the quality and protection of our pasturelands."

01_gordyene_task_13: "Aromatic Amomum"
01_gordyene_task_13_DESC: "Our amomum, similar to the cardamom of the Indoi of the east, serves as a much-loved flavoring and anti-inflamatory tool. Chefs along all the Tigris and Euphrates send orders for more of it as well as our native mints, laurels, and myrtles. The natural spices of our wild 'maquis' can  aid our economic ventures greatly. Let us cultivate more of these precious substances."

01_gordyene_task_14: "The Vineyards of Qardu"
01_gordyene_task_14_DESC: "Unlike those weak Greeks in the far west, we of Qardu drink our wine strong. Our vineyards are wealthy, and the markets of Mesopotamia are thirtsy for more. To maximize our profits and the happiness of our people, we must increase the production of our well-known wine." 

01_gordyene_task_15: "Mining Gagates"
01_gordyene_task_15_DESC: "Also called Gangitis, this rare jewel is a beauty to see. However, when melted, it produces a strong fume that scares off the likes of lizards and other creatures...so it is said. For these medicinal purposes and for its visual alure, the jewel is a quite valuable export along the Tigris river and should be utilized to the Karduchian economy's benefit."
