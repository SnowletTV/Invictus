#Missions

01_gordyene_task_1: "An Unruly People"
01_gordyene_task_1_DESC: "Though the Armenians have, in the past, held sway over us in the north, their time is not now. Our tribute to them is not a pleasure, but an annoyance. We call the mountains home - how shall they prsoper if we close off the Bitliss pass and refuse to remain their puppets?"

01_gordyene_task_2: "Fortifying the Mountains of Qardu"
01_gordyene_task_2_DESC: "Our lands are the mountain passes. To our northwest lies Mt. Masion, and to the northeast Mt. Niphates, where the ark of the animals is said to remain. Our importance in the region and our control of the regional trade routes depend on our ability to defend the pases and Tigris river crossings. We must thoroughly fortify these lines of communication in order to maintain and grow our position." 

01_gordyene_task_3: "Raiding the Seleukids"
01_gordyene_task_3_DESC: "TODO" # TODO

01_gordyene_task_4: "Consolidating the Upper Tigris"
01_gordyene_task_4_DESC: "TODO" # TODO

01_gordyene_task_5: "A Rival in Adiabene"
01_gordyene_task_5_DESC: "To the southeast, the kingdom state of Adiabene has always proven a threat to us. Their border is close to our southern pasture fields, and there have been several disputes between neighboring shepherds over whose herd should roam which hills. Due to our...rebellious...nature, they have often asked the regional overlords: the Achaemenids, and now the Seleukids, if they could assist in conquering our home. We must end their threat before they can act upon this desire."

01_gordyene_task_6: "Kingdom of Gordyene"
01_gordyene_task_6_DESC: "If the Karduchoi are to survive as a people in this ever-evolving world, then our lands and our lads must be joined together in a kingdom of the people. Our most powerful leader, he of the greatest tribe, shall sally forth and herald a new age - that of the Kingdom of Gordyene."

01_gordyene_task_7: "A Hurrian Kingdom"
01_gordyene_task_7_DESC: "The oldest of our tribes know of places where ancient bones stur, where the ruins of ancient temples stand. There are still those few hermits, reclusive men and women who mutter spells and curses under their breath in the silence of mountain peaks and cavern chambers. Yet, we should not look upon them with confusion or disdain. Theirs was a world of power, so the stories say. Perhaps there is a greater benefit to be had from learning their ways and renewing that which once was in these lands..."

01_gordyene_task_8: "The Triple-Citadel City"
01_gordyene_task_8_DESC: "The capital of Pinaka has already slowly developed into a wealthy place, sitting at a natural junction and crossing on the Tigris river. Three heights exist in the city - 2 on the west bank, and 1 on the east bank. Together, these places provide the perfect defensible positions from which to protect and survey the economic and military efforts along the river's stretch. It will also be enviously eyed, and must be protected at all costs."

01_gordyene_task_9: "The Master-Builders"
01_gordyene_task_9_DESC: "TODO" # TODO

01_gordyene_task_10: "Sareisa and Satalka"
01_gordyene_task_10_DESC: "TODO" # TODO

01_gordyene_task_11: "Crossroads of the Tigris"
01_gordyene_task_11_DESC: "TODO" # TODO

01_gordyene_task_12: "Karduchian Pasturelands"
01_gordyene_task_12_DESC: "For all the time that our collective memory holds, our people have mostly been mobile herders, setting our animals to pasture on the rich hills east of the Tigris and in the mountains south of the Armenian range. To both appease our tribal folk and to increase our natural wealth, we ought to improve the quality and protection of our pasturelands."

01_gordyene_task_13: "Aromatic Amomum"
01_gordyene_task_13_DESC: "Our amomum, similar to the cardamom of the Indoi of the east, serves as a much-loved flavoring and anti-inflamatory tool. Chefs along all the Tigris and Euphrates send orders for more of it as well as our native mints, laurels, and myrtles. The natural spices of our wild 'maquis' can  aid our economic ventures greatly. Let us cultivate more of these precious substances."

01_gordyene_task_14: "The Vineyards of Qardu"
01_gordyene_task_14_DESC: "Unlike those weak Greeks in the far west, we of Qardu drink our wine strong. Our vineyards are wealthy, and the markets of Mesopotamia are thirtsy for more. To maximize our profits and the happiness of our people, we must increase the production of our well-known wine." 

01_gordyene_task_15: "Mining Gagates"
01_gordyene_task_15_DESC: "Also called Gangitis, this rare jewel is a beauty to see. However, when melted, it produces a strong fume that scares off the likes of lizards and other creatures...so it is said. For these medicinal purposes and for its visual alure, the jewel is a quite valuable export along the Tigris river and should be utilized to the Karduchian economy's benefit."
