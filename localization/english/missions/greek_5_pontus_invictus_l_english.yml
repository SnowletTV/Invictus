 greek_5_9:0 "Forming the Istrian League"
 greek_5_9_DESC:0 "Future generations may bicker and squabble over whether it was in the pursuit of greater control of Euxine trade or out of a pragmatic sense of self-defense that guided our actions.

 greek_5_13_DESC:0 "River trade is the lifeblood of our cities. Nothing short of total control of the mouths of the rivers Tyras and Borysthenes, as well as the Bosporus Cimmerus, will suffice.

 greek_5_14:0 "A Pontic Fortress"

 greek_5_19:0 "Legacy of Colonization"
 greek_5_19_DESC:0 "Flung far from the city we once called home, the growth of our humble poleis has led many wondering if we are to repeat history and found a new city abroad?"
 greek_5_20:0 "A Noble Quest"
 greek_5_20_DESC:0 "Proper worship of the gods comes with sacrifice. We may be safe behind our walls and on the decks of our ships, but when called upon, honorable Greeks answer."
 greek_5_21:0 "In Iphegeneia's Footsteps"
