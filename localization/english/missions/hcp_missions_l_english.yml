 hcp_mission_01_task_01: "Securing The Succession"
 hcp_mission_01_task_01_DESC: "It is hardly a secret that Amastris' sons, Oxyathres and Klearchos have a deep-seated rivalry with one another and both eye their mother's position greedily.\n\nPerhaps if we arrange a joint wedding for the two of them with some of the most prestigious families of the old empire we can placate them before they consider anything...drastic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil28!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_02: "The Pontic League"
 hcp_mission_01_task_02_DESC: "The city states of Sesamos and Tieion are in a pact of mutual defense with us, perhaps with the right offer we can develop this relation into something more to our benefit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_03: "Stabilising Our Rule"
 hcp_mission_01_task_03_DESC: "While foreign enemies still surround us on all sides, our position is not quite as precarious as it was before. Now we have a sizeable powerbase we can begin to look outward and consider expanding our realm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil1!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_04: "Into Paphlagonia"
 hcp_mission_01_task_04_DESC: "If we are to survive the years to come our realm must expand. The northern coastline region of Paphlagonia is agreed to be the most suitable target. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_05: "Found Amastris"
 hcp_mission_01_task_05_DESC: "The 'city' of Sesamos is in reality just a collection of several seperately administered Greek colonies. We should centralise rule over them and found a true city worthy of our ancestors! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_06: "Pontic Magi"
 hcp_mission_01_task_06_DESC: "While we are tolerant folk and allow our subjects to worship who they please, there is no excuse for our lack of formal Zoroastrian priesthood, or '#E Magi#!' in our nation. Let us work to invite some learned men from the east to spread the light of #E Ahura Mazda#! to those who wish to listen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_07: "Pacify The Mariandyni"
 hcp_mission_01_task_07_DESC: "The Mariandynians are a fierce tribe of Thracians who are well known to chafe under foreign rule. Perhaps a softer approach is called for? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil2!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_08: "Thracian Auxiliaries"
 hcp_mission_01_task_08_DESC: "Our patronage and acceptance of the local Thracian tribesmen has borne fruit, and now many of them are now flocking to our army. We should establish formal auxiliary regiments for them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil11!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_09: "Orontid Overtures"
 hcp_mission_01_task_09_DESC: "The Orontid dynasty served our family as faithful satraps for generations. Let us remind them of the ties we share. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_10: "Develop Sinope"
 hcp_mission_01_task_10_DESC: "The city of #E Sinope#! is one of the oldest of all the Ionian colonies but has seen better days. We should take efforts to ensure its legacy as a major trade hub endures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_11: "Anatolian Citizenship"
 hcp_mission_01_task_11_DESC: "We should consider allowing the Anatolians more freedoms in our society, for the benefits will be manifold. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_12: "Military Reform"
 hcp_mission_01_task_12_DESC: "Simple words cannot begin to describe how woefully unprepared we were for a war against the Greeks. Alexander decisively defeated us on numerous occasions despite our clear numerical advantage. Efforts must be taken to ensure this never happens again! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_13: "Rethinking Our Tactics"
 hcp_mission_01_task_13_DESC: "It is clear from our studies that a reform of our command structure and military doctrine is needed. Our troops will likely struggle to keep up with this constant change, but we will be able to better focus on innovating our tactics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_14: "The New Immortals"
 hcp_mission_01_task_14_DESC: "The Greek historian Herodotus gave this name to our elite infantry force, due to them being kept constantly at a strength of exactly ten thousand men. Every killed, seriously wounded, or sick soldier was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining a cohesive force with a constant strength. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_15: "The Cataphract"
 hcp_mission_01_task_15_DESC: "Literally meaning "armoured" or "completely enclosed", the Cataphract was adapted from our Empire's early encounters with the Scythians and Parni tribes of the north. If we can ensure a stable supply of capable mounts bred solely for war, we will be able to field more of these nigh unstoppable cavalry! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil15!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_16: "Learning From Defeat"
 hcp_mission_01_task_16_DESC: "There is no denying that Alexander was a prodigy, unfathomably gifted in the art of war. In order to better protect ourselves from his Successors, we will try to entice the veterans of their campaigns to settle in our lands, for there is much we can learn from them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_17: "A True Persian Army"
 hcp_mission_01_task_17_DESC: "This has been a massive undertaking, but we have created a Persian army the likes of which has not been seen since the time of Darius I - the world will tremble! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil8!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_18: "Pontic Hegemony"
 hcp_mission_01_task_18_DESC: "We are now the undisputed masters of northern Anatolia. Foreign diplomats curry favour in our courts and Greek, Persian and Anatolian alike live together in relative harmony! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_19: "Fishy Business"
 hcp_mission_01_task_19_DESC: "The #E Pontus Euxinus#! is home to countless schools of fish, and investing into the fishing industry as well as the saltworks at [GetProvince('(int32)1807').GetName] will provide a boost to both our economy and population growth! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_20: "Rethinking Our Relationship"
 hcp_mission_01_task_20_DESC: "The Armenians have been steadfast allies during our meteoric resurgence. However, as we are now the clear senior partner in the alliance, perhaps it is time to reconsider our relationship...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_21: "Greco-Persian Culture"
 hcp_mission_01_task_21_DESC: "Greeks and Persians have a...complicated history, and erasing the animosity between our peoples will be no small task. If we can set aside our differences, there are countless things Greeks and Persians can learn from one another. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil16!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_22: "The Leontophoros"
 hcp_mission_01_task_22_DESC: "With a navy capable of protecting our coasts and projecting our power, leading shipwrights have put forward an ambitious, if not downright ludicrous, plan for a colossal flagship to prove our strength to the world! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil3!"

 hcp_mission_01_task_final: "The Achaemenid Kingdom"
 hcp_mission_01_task_final_DESC: "Though we are still far from home and our enemies still numerous, The Achaemenid dynasty is once more a formidable power and it is time to make our return known to the world! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_01_DESC: "Before we begin, we should call a meeting of our military and civil leaders to discuss the finer details of our campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_02: "Reclamation Of Athura"
 hcp_mission_02_task_02_DESC: "Before the fall of our empire, [GetProvince('(int32)870')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] was an integral and peaceful (aside from two regional-level revolts in 546 and 520 BC) province for over two centuries.\n\nKnown for their combat skills, Assyrian soldiers (along with the Lydians of Anatolia) constituted much of the main heavy infantry force of the Achaemenid army. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil2!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_03: "Babirush Bows Once More"
 hcp_mission_02_task_03_DESC: "The ancient city of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName], as well as the rest of [GetProvince('(int32)918')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], lies in our hands once more. These rich and fertile lands stand in stark contrast to the mountains and deserts our armies have marched through recently! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil5!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_04: "Honouring The Promise Of Cyrus"
 hcp_mission_02_task_04_DESC: "During repair work in [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName], one of our workers made an incredible discovery! A clay cylinder carved with Akkadian script was unearthed, with an inscription describing the labours of our ancestor, Cyrus the Great, and the promises he made to restore the glory of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName], vowing that all peoples would live in peace under his rule. If we emulate the acts inscribed on this relic, we will bring honour to both the people of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName] and the Achaemenid Dynasty! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_05: "Restore Imperial Diaspora"
 hcp_mission_02_task_05_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)918')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] was once home to a large number of Persians, most of whom fled (or were killed) during the Campaigns of Alexander and the Diadochi. Developing this fertile region should encourage them to call it home once more! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"
 
 hcp_mission_02_task_06: "Glorify Eanna And Ebbadar"
 hcp_mission_02_task_06_DESC: "Under their previous rulers, the holy temples of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_ishtar').GetName] and [GetDeityDefinition('omen_shamash').GetName] have been neglected and the gods, both of whom are held in high regard by the peoples of [GetProvince('(int32)918')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName], are insulted. We shall put our citizens minds at ease by embellishing their temples and founding beautiful cities in the names of their scorned gods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil16!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_07: "Crossing The Euphrates"
 hcp_mission_02_task_07_DESC: "On the western bank of the Euphrates lies the land of Syria, home to the [GetCulture('aramaic').GetName|E] and [GetCulture('phoenician').GetName|E] people. A land that will prosper under wise [GetCulture('pasargadi').GetName|E] rule! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic1!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_08: "Eber-Nari Restored"
 hcp_mission_02_task_08_DESC: "The province of Syria, or #E Eber-Nari#! in [GetCulture('pasargadi').GetName], is once more under Achaemenid rule.

 hcp_mission_02_task_09: "Negotiate With The Phoenicians"
 hcp_mission_02_task_09_DESC: "Everyone knows the story of Alexander's infamous siege of Tyre. The oligarchs and traders of Phoenicia rightfully take great pride in their independence and maritime prowess. Nonetheless, we may be able to entice the independent city-states into our sphere of influence by promising to safeguard the privileges of their traders and guilds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"
 
 hcp_mission_02_task_10: "The Capital Of Darius the Great"
 hcp_mission_02_task_10_DESC: "While Susa is an ancient city, the height of its power came under Darius the Great, who made it one of the four Royal Capitals of our Empire. We must do what we can to repair the damage caused by the Macedonian occupiers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_11: "Preparing For The Eastern Campaign"
 hcp_mission_02_task_11_DESC: "With the rich and fertile lands of Mesopotamia under our control, we can now begin to prepare for a push to the east into Persia proper. The formidable #E Zagros Mountains#! serve as a natural barrier between Mesopotamia and the rest of Persia that we can exploit to make it more difficult for our foes to attempt a counter-offensive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_12: "Appeal To The Fratarakas of Persis"
 hcp_mission_02_task_12_DESC: "The Seleukids created a satrapy in [GetProvince('(int32)4799')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] in a crude attempt to fool the Persian people into thinking they weren't shackled to the Ionian yoke! We will appeal directly to the governors of [GetCountry('PES').GetName|E] and offer them freedom from their foreign oppressors! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_13: "Land Of The First Lawgiver"
 hcp_mission_02_task_13_DESC: "#E Deioces#! 'The First Lawgiver' was the legendary founder, Shah and High Priest of the first independent Median state. We shall ensure his legacy is secured by bringing all of Media under our control! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil5!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_14: "The Persian Heartlands"
 hcp_mission_02_task_14_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)4799')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName], the land of our people, has for decades languished under the yoke of foreign rulers. We have come far from our small kingdom on the Pontic coast, but now, finally, the Achaemenid Dynasty is home. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_15: "Atropatene Submission"
 hcp_mission_02_task_15_DESC: "[GetCharacter('(int32)222').GetName] was a wise and responsible governor of Media, so much so that Alexander reappointed him after conquering the region. Let us see if his wisdom has passed on to his descendants...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil19!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_16: "Nisaean Horses"
 hcp_mission_02_task_16_DESC: "The Nisaean Horse, native to the Nisaean plain, has been the favoured horses of Persian nobility for centuries. We should develop the stables and breeding grounds for these majestic horses to ensure our military has an ample supply of mounts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil18!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_17: "The Seat Of Deioces"
 hcp_mission_02_task_17_DESC: "Deioces founded the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1595').GetName] and it grew to be the first true capital of the Medes. Unfortunately, the city has not received the investment its legacy demands under Greek rule. Let us reverse this decay as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_18: "The Fate Of Seleukia"
 hcp_mission_02_task_18_DESC: "After taking the lion's share of Alexander's collapsing Empire for himself, [GetCharacter('(int32)24').GetName], in his arrogance, shunned mighty Babylon in favour of a Greek colony named after himself! The question we now face is what to do with this city of his? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_19: "Legacy Of The Cyclops"
 hcp_mission_02_task_19_DESC: "There is much that could be said about 'The Cyclops', [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetName]. He was an outspoken defender of the independence of the myriad of small Greek states that litter the Mediterranean.\n\nA talented general, he defeated the other Diadochi multiple times and only fell when the cowards formed a united coalition against him. While we recognise his achievements, does his legacy - one that aided a foreign conqueror in the humiliation and enslavement of the Persian people - deserve to continue? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic3!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_20: "Northern Anabasis"
 hcp_mission_02_task_20_DESC: "The Highlands of [GetProvince('(int32)3440')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] serve as a natural barrier between Persia and the steppes and deserts further north. Securing this region is vital, as without it we will be ill prepared to face any incursions from the nomadic tribes such as the Dahae. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_21: "Eastern Anabasis"
 hcp_mission_02_task_21_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)6552')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] may be sparsely populated and littered with harsh, unforgiving terrain, but it is nonetheless an integral part of Persia and it must return to Achaemenid rule! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil9!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_22: "Renovate The Tomb Of Cyrus"
 hcp_mission_02_task_22_DESC: "In [GetProvince('(int32)4951').GetName] lies an impressive tomb built from yellowish-white limestone; the final resting place of #E Cyrus the Great#!. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_23: "Delving Into The [GetProvince('(int32)4799').GetName] Archives"
 hcp_mission_02_task_23_DESC: "We have been fortunate to discover that the extensive administrative archives in Persepolis appear to have mostly survived the burning of the city perpetrated by Alexander. With the city back in Persian hands, we can learn much from the information recorded here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil17!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_24: "Fortify The Northern Border"
 hcp_mission_02_task_24_DESC: "Without fortifications, our nothern border in [GetProvince('(int32)3440')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] is highly vulnerable to incursions by the nomadic tribes on the northern steppes. Fortifying the passes through the Parthian mountains should put our citizen's minds at ease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil18!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_25: "Nomad Submission"
 hcp_mission_02_task_25_DESC: "Across the Parthian mountains lie many nomadic peoples who, if unified, could be a grave threat to our Kingdom's existence. We should approach the largest of these tribes and offer our friendship and protection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_26: "Fortress-City Of [GetProvince('(int32)843').GetName]"
 hcp_mission_02_task_26_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)843').GetName] stands watch over the strategically important [GetProvince('(int32)992').GetName] pass through the Zagros Mountains. Improving the defences there should provide adequate protection for our northern flank while we campaign in the east. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"

 hcp_mission_02_task_27: "[GetProvince('(int32)786').GetName] Shipbuilding"
 hcp_mission_02_task_27_DESC: "We should make use of the extensive supply of cedar in [GetProvince('(int32)784').GetName] by funding the construction of a large shipyard on the nearby Phoenician coast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 
hcp_mission_02_task_final: "Return Of The Achaemenids"
 hcp_mission_02_task_final_DESC: "They thought us beaten, shattered, deposed and humbled, but we have defied fate itself and reclaimed our ancestral lands. Glory to Persia, Glory to the Achaemenids! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil10!"
