[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was the first to step foot on the land and was in the process of helping others disembark when a loud shout was heard from the forest.

me_horn_of_africa_77_desc: "One morning, three battered liburnians flying the flag of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)8704').GetName] were seen on the horizon, and as our soldiers gathered in the harbor district to see if this strange armada was commanded by friends or foes, a murmur of disbelief swept through the crowd - these ships were a part of the #E Rhaptan Armada#! that left our lands over two decades ago.\n\nThe leader of this expedition, a grizzled old man known as [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetName], was summoned to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for an audience with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. The story told by [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] was hard to believe, but the admiral insisted that every word was true.\n\nTwenty years ago, the Armada sailed south until they reached a massive island that the Greeks call #E 'Menouthias'#!, and it was here that the city of #E Rhapta#! was found. Much to the surprise of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], the citizens of Rhapta were well-aware of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and desired to establish permanent trading connections with our people - something that [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] was proud to achieve for our countrymen. Treaties of mutual understanding were signed between our representatives and theirs, and laden down with gifts, our ships prepared to sail home.\n\nThis is where the story becomes difficult, and [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] had a tough time sharing his thoughts, pausing every few words to gulp down wine and stare into the distance as bitter memories overshadowed his mind. A fearsome storm in the #E Mare Erythraeum#! scattered our boats at sea, and as our men attempted to regroup, a gigantic #E sea monster#! appeared from the depths of the ocean and launched into our crafts, killing hundreds of Macrobians and breaking the armada to pieces. Ten ships were barely able to escape the awful attack when all was said and done, but the poor survivors were all marked as dead men, for their boats had been heavily damaged and were in no condition to sail home. For weeks, they drifted lifelessly in the ocean, unable to find the wind or land, and many Macrobians succumbed to dehydration or madness in those desperate hours.\n\nIn the face of these overwhelming odds, our sailors refused to give up, but pressed onward in hopes of somehow returning home. And their faith was rewarded, for they soon found dry land and were able to obtain fresh supplies, but they had to fight hostile tribes and many of our soldiers died on the beaches of the strange land that they found themselves in. Many of our boats were lost upon the rocks, and [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] wiped a tear from his cheek as he recounted seeing his brothers struggling in the water as they were eaten alive by sharks. The old man told dreadful stories for hours, enchanting all that were present with his exploits, and many of his tales can be found in the #E Periplus#! that bears his name - a treasure that was presented to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nThankfully for [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName], his story had a good ending. For twenty years, a handful of our adventurers managed to survive, and in the process, they circumnavigated #E Africa#! - [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] claims that they eventually made their way to the western entrance of the #E Mediterranean#! and were able to sail into the #E Sinus Arabicus#! after bribing the #E Alexandrians#! to allow them safe passage.\n\nSignaling that he was too tired to share any more details of the ill-fated expedition, [SCOPE.sCharacter('macrobian_rhaptan_admiral').GetFirstName] rose to his feet, his scarred back arched and bent by the difficult years, and saluted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].
