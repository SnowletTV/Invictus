 iberia_missions: "The Rise of the Iberian Kings"
 iberia_missions_DESCRIPTION: "If one sails from the great port cities of the Mediterranean, following the waterways past Byzantion until you reach the Pontus Euxinus, you will eventually reach a distant shore where a colossal mountain range, the Caucasus, rises to break up the vast northern steppe - this unforgiving land is our home. We have our own traditions here, worshiping the true gods that are unknown to outsiders, and although we are surrounded by enemies that would love to evict us from our highland cities, they have been unable to do so.\n\nNow, instead of giving our foes the chance to act upon their foul intentions, we must take our destiny firmly in hand."
 iberia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the rulers of Iberia push back their neighbors, establishing a strong and secure nation that is able to project their power far from our mountain homeland."
 iberia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Iberia will not succumb to her enemies...quite the contrary, in fact."

 #Missions
 iberia_missions_task_1: "Surrounded By Enemies"
 iberia_missions_task_1_DESC: "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides; the grim Armenians to the south, arrogant Colchis to our west and the wild Albanians to the east. Because our military advisors cannot come to a consensus, we will fabricate claims on everyone around us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 iberia_missions_task_2: "The Push For The Coasts"
 iberia_missions_task_2_DESC: "Our recent victories come with the tantalizing promise of even greater rewards in the days ahead; if our soldiers continue to push onward, we will not only reach the shores of the Mare Hyrcanum, but we could even gain access to the waters of Pontus Euxinus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 iberia_missions_task_3: "Land Of The Fleece"
 iberia_missions_task_3_DESC: "Even though we have shattered the might of [GetProvince('(int32)1715').GetArea.GetName], there are still fears that they could return to a position of strength. It has become clear that we must utterly eradicate them, in order to prevent this possibility from ever happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 iberia_missions_task_4: "Albanian Scraps"
 iberia_missions_task_4_DESC: "Our forces continue to destroy the Albanian tribesmen; now that we are firmly in control of their heartlands, it won't be long before we finish eating up the rest of the scraps of their kingdom.\n\nNow that they are firmly in hand, we must pass judgment on their nation - we will not only seize their territories, but we will take their precious resources as well - the fish from the #E Mare Hyrcanum#! are said to be very delicious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
 iberia_missions_task_5: "Getting Our Feet Wet"
 iberia_missions_task_5_DESC: "Although we are new powerbrokers in the region, our presence in the Pontus Euxinus will soon be made known to all - our shipbuilding initiative will expand our influence far from the shores of our homeland! We shall connect our capital to the sea by road, and then the entire world shall be opened up to us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 iberia_missions_task_6: "Empower The Eristavi"
 iberia_missions_task_6_DESC: "The Eristavi were a ennobled class of local rulers, with responsibilities similar to those of a governor, and were entrusted by the Pharnavazids with ruling over provinces in their name.

 iberia_missions_task_8_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)1572').GetName] sits at the conjunction of three rivers, making it an important city for the flow of travelers and merchant ships.

 iberia_missions_task_10: "Armenian Fortifications"
 iberia_missions_task_10_DESC: "Because we have taken so many of the great cities of Armenia for ourselves, we are privy to vast stores of knowledge that we did not have access to before. Everyone knows that the Armenians build masterful fortifications, so why don't we teach our own engineers how to mimic their style? We will soon fill our royal libraries with their architectural treatises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 iberia_missions_task_11: "The Walls Of [GetProvince('(int32)1676').GetName]"
 iberia_missions_task_11_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)1676').GetName] is certainly an imposing site already, but we believe that we could make our fortress and citadel even harder to capture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

 iberia_missions_task_12_DESC: "For the first time in the history of our people, the adherents of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] faith have been united under one crown, with the power of our neighboring enemies destroyed for a generation or more.

 iberia_missions_task_13: "Iberian Wine"
 iberia_missions_task_13_DESC: "Our people are renowned for their skill at fermenting wine, a hobby which we have been pursuing for thousands of years. When the harvests have come in, we fill giant earthenware containers that we call 'kvevri' in our tongue and bury them deep into the ground. Those who drink Iberian wine can often find other vintages lacking in flavor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"
 iberia_missions_task_14: "Blood Of Pharnavazid"
 iberia_missions_task_14_DESC: "Because of the reforms ushered in by the Pharnavazid Dynasty, the glory of our people has been secured for generations. From our fortress at [GetProvince('(int32)1676').GetName] we reign over an expansive kingdom, one that we have put together with our own hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

Our military advisors cannot decide who is the weakest of our neighbors, adding to the confusion, so it has been decided that we should fabricate claims in all directions and wait for an opportune moment to expand."

Still, we salute the bravery of their fighters and regret the circumstances that forced us to slay our Caucasian brethren.\n\nNow that the final submission of the Albanian leaders has been received, it has been suggested that we create a feudatory state out of the remaining tribes. Some voices in our government have suggested that such uncouth savages should be kept at arm's length, while others argue that they deserve the same opportunities that our other citizens have.\n\nUnfortunately for the Albanians, the resolve of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has never been more firm."
