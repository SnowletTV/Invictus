 indian_mission_01_gandara:0 "An Indo-Greek Kingdom"
 indian_mission_01_gandara_DESCRIPTION:0 "India is a vast continent, awash in riches and home to ancient cultures, religions and customs that are alien to us Hellenes. We have established a foothold in the upper Indus Valley, securing our control over the regions of Gandara and Pentapotamia, which will serve as the heartland and capital region of our new kingdom. The Indus Valley is home to many different cultures and tribes, many of which were conquered by Alexander himself years ago. Our first order of business should be to restore and construct Greek communities in the region, and then expand south down the Indus until we reach the Erythraean Sea. This will bring us into conflict with the Mauryas, and we should be well prepared."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete after we have conquered the entirety of the Indus valley and established our new heartland."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "The upper Indus Valley is fed by several large rivers is incredibly fertile, with ample room for development and growth. While mostly agrarian and underpopulated at the moment, the Gandaran and Pentapotamian valleys could serve as a vibrant and wealthy new capital region for our kingdom. However, this will require ample investment from our end, and we will need to fight off the Maurya Empire and other powerful Indian states to expand our control."

 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_1_DESC:0 "Our new conquests in India have caused our royal court to descend into chaos. Noble families squabble and bicker over who will rule our new lands, and the current Basileus is seen as too weak to prevent our kingdom from collapsing into smaller feuding states. However, in the background, a new figure has arrived at court and some believe he may be just the man we need to rule."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_2_DESC:0 "Our old capital is quite far from our holdings in India, and some in our court believe it is necessary to move it to a more central and accessible location. [GetProvince('(int32)4340').GetName] has been suggested as a potential new royal city and capital for the Indo-Greek Kingdom."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_3_DESC:0 "We have established control over Gandara and Pentapotamia, however the rest of the Indus river, including access to the Erythraean Sea, lies in enemy hands. We are the inheritors of Alexander's empire, and his former lands in India rightfully belong to us."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_4_DESC:0 "The provinces of [GetProvince('(int32)4340').GetArea.GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)4380').GetArea.GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)4414').GetArea.GetName] form the heartland of our kingdom. Extensive urbanization and investment is required to elevate and enrich these provinces."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_5_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)4340').GetName] has grown from a small settlement to a thriving city, as immigrants from across our kingdom settle in our new capital. However, by most measures [GetProvince('(int32)4340').GetName] is still a relatively small city with a limited Greek presence. Building up our capital with new infrastructure will help attract potential settlers."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_6_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)4340').GetName] is now a major city. Establishing it as a true Greco-Indian metropolis will increase our legitimacy and bring great prestige to our royal family."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_7_DESC:0 "The Gandhari people make up the majority of our Indian subjects, and if we are to rule this land peacefully, we must also extend an olive branch to the inhabitants of this newly conquered region. This will, in turn, help us avoid conflict and tension in the future."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_8_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)7485').GetName] was the easternmost settlement founded by Alexander during his attempted conquest of India.

 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_11_DESC:0 "The province of Gandara forms the main passage to the lands of Bactria and Aria beyond. It hosts many ancient cities and is becoming an important religious center for Buddhism. Gandara will undoubtedly become one of our most prosperous provinces if we invest wisely and build up its cities."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_12_DESC:0 "The University of [GetProvince('(int32)7314').GetName] is an ancient and important center of learning, attracting scholars from across India and beyond. We should expand the campuses at the university and transform it into a center of learning that will rival those in Greece and Egypt."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_13_DESC:0 "Alexander founded two cities on the Hydaspes River, [GetProvince('(int32)4322').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)4316').GetName]. These Greek settlements have dwindled in size and are now only home to a few thousand Macedonian settlers. Expanding these cities with new public works will ensure that these two Hellenic settlements become great cities."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_14_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)4300').GetName] is the capital of Gandara. Establishing a palace here for our royal court and expanding existing Greek temples and theatres will transform it into a secondary capital for our new kingdom."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_15_DESC:0 "The Gandaran passage is treacherous and mountainous, but also represents a possible access route for enemy invasion. Fortifying this region will insulate our Indian heartland from possible Western invasion."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_16_DESC:0 "Gandara has been established as the newest province of our kingdom, with its capital in [GetProvince('(int32)4300').GetName]. It has already become an important center for learning and religion, and will thrive under our administration."

 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_18_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)4371').GetName] was established at the fork of the Indus River by Alexander the Great and represents the largest and most important Hellenistic settlement in the region. It will grow in importance as an entrepot between the ports at the mouth of the Indus and our capital."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_19_DESC:0 "The Indus river is fertile and has many large cities that lie upon its banks. Expanding the commercial potential of this region will turn it into a wealthy and powerful center for trade and agriculture."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_20_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6821').GetName] is our main link to the Erythraean Sea and will become our main port city as well. Now that we finally have access to the sea, we can expand our trade with the rest of India and the nations that lie beyond."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_21_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)6815').GetName] is the capital of the province of Patalene, but has suffered from flooding and mismanagement. It will be refounded and rebuilt as a proper Hellenic city and be bestowed with a new name."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_22_DESC:0 "Our new province of India has been established, with wealth flowing into our ports and down the Indus river to our capital region of Panduorum. The vast expansion of our commercial potential will allow us to fund larger armies and expand further into the Indian continent."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_23_DESC:0 "India's Hellenic population is small and ultimately unsustainable if we wish to impose our rule upon the people we have conquered. We should attempt to attract settlers from our Hellenic homelands in Greece and Macedonia to settle in our kingdom. With much of Greece and Anatolia plagued with war and chaos, we should have no problem attracting immigrants."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_24_DESC:0 "A new religion is thriving in India, founded by a man named Gautama Buddha only a few hundred years ago. We have conquered many important Buddhist holy sites, and some members of our royal court have converted, having been attracted to its teachings of peace. If we are to rule India, perhaps it will be necessary to abandon Hellenism..."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_25_DESC:0 "As we conquer more land in India, our culture seems to drift further and further apart from that of Greece. While we have no desire to abandon our Hellenic roots, embracing aspects of Indian culture would be a prudent decision."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_26_DESC:0 "The House of Euthydemid has grown rapidly since their ascent to power, with many members of the family holding important positions in the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Euthydemid bloodline has become a symbol of power and legitimacy."
 indian_mission_01_gandara_task_final_DESC:0 "The Indo-Greek Kingdom has grown rapidly, and our royal family reigns supreme over its lands. Our leader has taken on the moniker of 'Ragias' instead of 'Basileus', and has staked his claim as ruler over all India."
