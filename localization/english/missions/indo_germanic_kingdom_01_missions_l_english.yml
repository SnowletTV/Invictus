igk_mission:0 "The Unthinkable Migration"
igk_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Years ago, few could have ever imagined the events which have recently transpired. Yet, despite how implausible, nonsensical, irrational, or even insane our goals may have seen at the time, we have managed to do the unthinkable; a legendary migration halfway across the world through dense forests, icy tundra, endless grasslands, harsh deserts, and the most imposing, impregnable mountains the world has to offer. Now that we have established ourselves in India, it is time to secure our presence here permanently, and though daunting challanges remain ahead, through our continued conquest of neighboring kingdoms and the integration of our diverse subjects, whose unique, exotic customs differ vastly from our own, we can establish an Indo-Germanic empire which will forever-change the history of the sub-continent, and indeed, the history of the world."

igk_mauryan_records_fake_desc:0 "Looking at what first appears to be a priceless treatise detailing the entire bureaucratic apparatus of the Mauryan Empire, further inspection, however, reveals it to be an obvious forgery with no value whatsoever. In-fact, applying those 'theories' postulated in the document might actually end up making the day-to-day affairs of government more inefficient."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_112_desc:0 "A year ago, [SCOPE.sCharacter('igk_employed_bureaucrat').GetName] left our court traveling the major centers of the former Mauryan Empire to study the administrative techniques which allowed the Mauryan bureaucracy to remain effective and efficient over such a vast domain. Not only has [SCOPE.sCharacter('igk_employed_bureaucrat').GetSheHe] returned having failed to find any of the cities in question, but foolishly purchased a clearly-forged document using the funds we gave him, reflecting poorly on both [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as a whole."
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_112.a:0 "It could look nice in my basement, I guess."

Because this document originated from their arch-rival of Maurya, they say that it was set to be destroyed, but out of a desire to preserve history, they took great personal risk to smuggle it here to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] against the wishes of their government. In exchange for a small fee to cover their travel expenditure, they have offered it to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Some of our closest advisors, however, have warned that there is no way to verify the document's authenticity until after we purchase it, and this could all be an elaborite scam."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_119_title:0 "Failure"
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_119_desc:0 "Unfortunately [SCOPE.sCountry('igk_scam_target').GetRuler.GetName] was too wise and saw straight through our guise, expelling our disguised envoys without paying as much as a dime, who were humiliated and forced to retreat under cover of the night skies. Now, we are stuck with this worthless piece of paper."

Those vile [SCOPE.sCountry('igk_indo_germanic_kingdom_scam').GetAdjective] barbarians robbed us in broad daylight, making us look like fools."

This document is priceless, and much will be able to be gleamed from its pages over the following years. There is no way that those [SCOPE.sCountry('igk_indo_germanic_kingdom_scam').GetAdjective] brigands would have ever willingly parted with it at such a low price, suggesting they thought it was fraudulent and intended to scam us."

However, after handing the scroll over, it was discovered that it was not a forgery after all, but instead was actually a secret and invaluable treatese detailing the inner-most workings of the entire Mauryan bureaucratic apparatus, and we sold it for a mere fraction of its value. To add insult to injury, [SCOPE.sCountry('igk_scam_target').GetRuler.GetName] has sent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] a humiliating letter gloating about [SCOPE.sCountry('igk_scam_target').GetRuler.GetHerHis] new treasure."
