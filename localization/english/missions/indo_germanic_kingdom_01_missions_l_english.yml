igk_mission:0 "The Unthinkable Migration"
igk_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Years ago, few could have ever imagined the events which have recently transpired. Yet, despite how implausible, nonsensical, irrational, or even insane our goals may have seen at the time, we have managed to do the unthinkable; a legendary migration halfway across the world through dense forests, icy tundra, endless grasslands, harsh deserts, and the most imposing, impregnable mountains the world has to offer. Now that we have established ourselves in India, it is time to secure our presence here permanently, and though daunting challanges remain ahead, through our continued conquest of neighboring kingdoms and the integration of our diverse subjects, whose unique, exotic customs differ vastly from our own, we can establish an Indo-Germanic empire which will forever-change the history of the sub-continent, and indeed, the history of the world."

In order to protect our people from these bandits, we should seize the province of Chomolangma and push the scoundrels back into the mountains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil20!"

me_zhangzhung_1_desc:0 "When [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] received reports on two consecutive days in a row that bandits from [GetProvince('(int32)5588').GetArea.GetName] have been crossing into our border and killing some of the locals, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rage was all-consuming. Realizing that this situation will only continue to get worse, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has made the difficult decision to fabricate claims on foreign lands. Although some of the Elders doubt the wisdom of this path, there is nothing left to be said on the matter."
