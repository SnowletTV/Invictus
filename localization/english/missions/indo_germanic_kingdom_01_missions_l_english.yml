igk_mission:0 "The Unthinkable Migration"
igk_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Years ago, few could have ever imagined the events which have recently transpired. Yet, despite how implausible, nonsensical, irrational, or even insane our goals may have seen at the time, we have managed to do the unthinkable; a legendary migration halfway across the world through dense forests, icy tundra, endless grasslands, harsh deserts, and the most imposing, impregnable mountains the world has to offer. Now that we have established ourselves in India, it is time to secure our presence here permanently, and though daunting challenges remain ahead, through our continued conquest of neighboring kingdoms and the integration of our diverse subjects, whose unique, exotic customs differ vastly from our own, we can establish an Indo-Germanic empire which will forever-change the history of the sub-continent, and indeed, the history of the world."
igk_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have forged a vast Indo-Germanic empire spanning the entire sub-continent, from the Indus in the west, to the Ganges in the east, and Lanka to the south."

igk_mission_invite_religion_new_DESC:0 "India is a land as vast as it is diverse; a massive melting pot of faith, philosophy, and ideals of all shapes and sizes. Being newcomers to the region, we are but a single voice in this vast ocean we now find ourselves apart of. We must decide the direction we are to take for the future of our people, and what better way is there to make an informed decision then to invite some of the greatest thinkers of this age to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], the very heart and soul of our fledgling kingdom?" #lest we desire to drown in all of the noise, w
igk_mission_adopt_new_faith:0 "The Council of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]" 
igk_mission_adopt_new_faith_DESC:0 "With all of these great minds gathered in our capital and having made their case, it is time to make a choice: Do we remain with our old gods in whom we have trusted during our long journey, or do we wholeheartedly embrace one of these intruiging new philosophies? It is time to hold a great council in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to decide once-and-for-all our future. Regardless of what is decided, however, there will be some in our country disappointed with our decision." 

igk_mission_synchronize_with_local_deities:0 "Synchronize with Local Deities" 
igk_mission_synchronize_with_local_deities_DESC:0 "Although popular with the country's elite, the decision to remain true to our gods was disappointing, to say the least, for the vast majority of our subjects. By synchronizing our deities with local equivalents, our pantheon will become more palatable to them, and, in due time, our subjects will come to accept our gods as their own." 
igk_mission_build_the_pillars_of_wotan:0 "Build the Pillars of Wotan" 
igk_mission_build_the_pillars_of_wotan_DESC:0 "To further aid the spread of our faith among our subjects, we can construct 9 great pillars for each of the other-worldly realms, depicting the greatness of our gods and embellishing the glories of Valhalla, the ultimate reward of all warriors who die an honorable death!" 

igk_mission_convince_elite:0 "Convince the Elite" 
igk_mission_convince_elite_DESC:0 "Although the council's word was final, there are still many influential holdouts who are stubbornly clinging on to the old ways. By ensuring their personal loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], however, their hands will be tied." 
igk_mission_patronize_new_faith:0 "Patronize New Faith" 
igk_mission_patronize_new_faith_DESC:0 "Even though we have adopted a local region as the official state religion, not all of our people adhere to it, however. By patronizing the construction of great temples and libraries throughout our lands, we can ensure that more converts will come forward each passing day." 

igk_mission_religious_harmony:0 "Religious Harmony" 
igk_mission_religious_harmony_DESC:0 "With the matter of religion decisively-decided, we have ensured an age of harmony and prosperity for all those who call the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] home, in-turn, aiding to secure our rule here for generations to come." 

igk_mission_syncronize:0 "Cultural Synchronization"
igk_mission_syncronize_DESC:0 "Until very recently, we were a small tribe wandering the frozen forests of northern Europe; with our unfathomable and rapid conquests in India, however, that leaves us in a precarious position of being an incredibly small minority ruling over a massive majority, whose unique and diverse customs are largely foreign to us. If we wish to survive for long in this sub-continent, we should consider learning the ways of our subjects."

igk_mission_adopt_local_food:0 "Adopt Local Culinary Practices"
igk_mission_adopt_local_food_DESC:0 "One of the major ways in which our culture differs from our Indian subjects is how we prepare our food, where they have learned to incorporate numerous hot and exotic spices as a measure to preserve meals for longer periods of time in this humid environment. By encouraging our people to try Indian-style dishes, we will gain a taste for spicy heat, and in-turn, we will help to bridge the gap between us and our subjects."

igk_mission_pacify_local_areas:0 "To Each His Own Law"
igk_mission_pacify_local_areas_DESC:0 "There are many areas outside our capital which are restive and actively resist our rule; by establishing specialized Indian courts of law wherein Indian subjects can be tried according to Indian law instead of Germanic law, the people will come to see our rule for how just it is, and in-turn, will recognize the laws of our kingdom as the rightful laws of the land."

igk_mission_study_tactics:0 "Study Indian Tactics"
igk_mission_study_tactics_DESC:0 "For thousands of years, armies have fought and waged war across this sub-continent through rugged and hostile terrain. Even though we have had prior successes fighting over here, this land is still largely foreign and exotic to our commanders. Though it may take awhile, by adapting Indian tactics into our armies, we will gain the upper hand on the battlefield. It would be foolish, after all, not to learn from those who have been here the longest."

igk_mission_integrate_local_nobility:0 "Integrate Local Nobility"
igk_mission_integrate_local_nobility_DESC:0 "We arrived here as foreign conquerors, displacing the previous leadership in this area from their seats of power. That does not mean, however, that those ancient and noble families have any less sway or influence in the eyes of our subjects; by appeasing the old order and intermingling our bloodlines, we will secure their integration and loyalty to our kingdom."

igk_mission_hybridization:0 "Hybridization"
igk_mission_hybridization_DESC:0 "After years of integrating and intermixing our people into Indic society, the lines between us and our subjects has blurred, making it difficult, if not impossible, for many to tell who is Germanic and who is Indian. Although the old guard will protest initially, we can now formally proclaim ourselves to be Indo-Germanic, a mixture neither wholly Germanic, nor wholly Indian; the best of both worlds."

igk_mission_northern_expansion:0 "Northern Expansion"
igk_mission_northern_expansion_DESC:0 "Although we have had an initially successful conquest, there is much more to India then the region surrounding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]; The lands to the north hold the great and mighty rivers Ganges and Indus, whose life-bringing waters have fueled the rise of great civilizations for millennia. By launching an invasion northward, we will be able to secure both rivers and all lands in-between, granting our fledgling kingdom great riches and wealth."

igk_mission_conquer_burma:0 "The Conquest of Burma"
igk_mission_conquer_burma_DESC:0 "A land hidden by thick jungles and tall mountains, the land of Burma is as mysterious as it is enticing, with potentially many rare and undiscovered resources up for the taking. By striking to the east of India and conquering into the unknown, we will surely be rewarded for our great gamble."

igk_mission_to_the_indus:0 "To the Indus"
igk_mission_to_the_indus_DESC:0 "Once the beating heart of Indic civilization long ago, the fertile Indus is often the first stepping-stone for any would-be-conqueror into India. By seizing its riches for our ourselves, we will follow in the footsteps of past empires, securing our legacy in history."

igk_mission_the_ganges:0 "The Ganges"
igk_mission_the_ganges_DESC:0 "The modern center of India, the bountiful Ganges is what fuels great empires in this sub-continent, and we would be fools not to want this power for ourselves! Although it is currently occupied, by defeating its master in glorious combat, we shall seize total control of the wealth and riches this area provides."

igk_mission_the_center:0 "The Center"
igk_mission_the_center_DESC:0 "The Avanti region is the geographical center of Northern India, making it a vital cross-roads for any aspiring lord of the north. By seizing it, we shall ensure connectivity between the Ganges and Indus."

igk_mission_destroy_maurya:0 "Destroy Maurya"
igk_mission_destroy_maurya_DESC:0 "The great and mighty empire of the Mauryas is the preeminent power of India, whose might and influence remain unmatched, at least that is until now, however. By laying waste to our greatest rival and facilitating their utter destruction at our hand, we will be able to ensure that we will reign undisputed, and that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] age shall truly begin."

igk_mission_write_the_indo_germanic_saga:0 "Write the Indo-Germanic Saga"
igk_mission_write_the_indo_germanic_saga_DESC:0 "In the past few years, we have done the unthinkable, continuing to prove the most learned of men wrong time-and-time again. It is time that we commemorate our glorious feats for time immortal by writing an epic saga whose pages will be told and re-told across the generations for a thousand years."

igk_mission_rehabilitate_pataliputra:0 "Rehabilitate Pataliputra"
igk_mission_rehabilitate_pataliputra_DESC:0 "Pataliputra, the rich and prosperous capital city of our greatest rival, now lays in our hands. By tearing away any traces of Mauryan civilization, remodeling key landmarks after our own likeness, and establishing offices there for our high-ranking officials, we will be able to re-make the city in our image as its old identity is forgotten, ensuring its loyalty as a cornerstone of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

igk_mission_study_mauryan_administrative_records:0 "Study Mauryan Administrative Records"
igk_mission_study_mauryan_administrative_records_DESC:0 "Although we vanquished it in combat, we have much to learn from the inner-workings of the Mauryan Empire, which was able to effectively manage and administer its rule over a vast and sprawling territory. By studying the records they left behind, we will be in a better position to steward these lands we now find ourselves lording over."

igk_mission_monopolize_sugar:0 "Monopolize Sugar"
igk_mission_monopolize_sugar_DESC:0 "Through our conquests, we have discovered a very rare and unusual spice the locals call 'Sugar', which adds sweet instead of heat to everything it coats. In fact, many who eat too much of it become highly energetic and excited before crashing out. With the only select few areas capable of producing this substance in substantial quantity happening to fall under our control, by ramping up production in those areas, we can establish a complete monopoly on the sugar trade."

igk_mission_establish_settlements_along_the_indus:0 "Establish Indus Settlements"
igk_mission_establish_settlements_along_the_indus_DESC:0 "Now that we have conquered the Indus, we must control and defend our conquests. By establishing a series of border fortresses across key cities along the river, we will not only protect our territories from outside incursion, but with a bit of additional enticements, we will also encourage $indo_germanic$ settlers into the surrounding towns and cities, ensuring their loyalty to our kingdom."

igk_mission_colonize_burma:0 "Colonize Burma"
igk_mission_colonize_burma_DESC:0 "Although the conquest of this mysterious land is technically complete, there are still many areas here which exist outside our effective administration, however. By establishing new cities in the region and inviting settlers from our heartland, we can effectively tame this jungle."

igk_mission_mine_for_burmese_amber:0 "Mine For Amber"
igk_mission_mine_for_burmese_amber_DESC:0 "Rumors abound in the remote territory #Y [GetProvince('(int32)8783').GetName]#! of vast, untapped deposits of amber lurking under the surface, which has not been mined previously due to a lack of interest for the material. However, we have been dredging precious amber for generations, long before our migration to this continent, and with our expertise, we would be able to maximize amber output. If we send over an expedition to investigate the source of these rumors, we could become wealthy fairly quickly."

igk_mission_southern_expansion:0 "Southern Expansion"
igk_mission_southern_expansion_DESC:0 "Although we have had an initially successful conquest, there is much more to India then the region surrounding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]; The lands to the south are home to many rare and exotic spices widely valued abroad, and whose port cities are strategically located to benefit off of the seasonal monsoon trade winds. By conquering the Tamil kings of the south, we will secure control over a rich nexus of trade, in-turn, fueling our economy."

igk_mission_the_west_coast:0 "The West Coast"
igk_mission_the_west_coast_DESC:0 "Many ships traversing the great Erythraean pass by the western shoreline of Aparanta every year, granting whoever controls it a valuable and reliable source of revenue. By marching to the coast, we will be able to take our piece of this pie."

igk_mission_build_west_coast_city:0 "Grand West-Coast Port"
igk_mission_build_west_coast_city_DESC:0 "There are many cities along the Erythraean shoreline, yet few are as well-developed as the great ports of the south, such as Koti and Satiyaputra. If we were to invest significant resources into one of these candidate cities to build a massive sea port, it would become a major gateway to the west."

igk_mission_the_jungle:0 "The Great Jungle"
igk_mission_the_jungle_DESC:0 "The great jungle tribes of Vindhyaprstha are skilled warriors who defend their homes with honor and valor. If we can tame these jungle-warriors, they would be a valuable addition to our armies."

igk_mission_secure_our_control_over_the_jungle:0 "Secure Control Over The Jungle"
igk_mission_secure_our_control_over_the_jungle_DESC:0 "Although we have conquered the great jungles of Vindhyaprstha through military might, many of the remote areas are not exactly forthcoming to our rule here. By establishing cities along the key transit points in the region, we will establish the legitimacy of our administration."

igk_mission_seize_madurai:0 "The South"
igk_mission_seize_madurai_DESC:0 "The great Tamil kingdoms of the south have always been places of great wealth and prosperity due to their skill at navigating the rough seas and their location as the end-nexus of Erythraean trade. By absorbing the numerous southern kingdoms into our realm, we will be able to reap the rewards of the ever-giving sea."

igk_mission_sri_lanka:0 "Seize Sri Lanka"
igk_mission_sri_lanka_DESC:0 "Although not quite an island, Sri Lanka is nonetheless strategically located and is a defensible location. By conquering the area, we will be able to secure trade coming from the eastern ocean."

igk_mission_crush_the_tamil_kings:0 "Crush the Tamil Kings"
igk_mission_crush_the_tamil_kings_DESC:0 "For generations, the various Tamil Kings have dominated southern India, from the Pandiyas, to the Cheras, and the Cholas, all vying for power and control. However, with the surrender of the last Tamil king, we have forcefully brought about the end to this chapter of Indian history. With all of Dravida under our control, we now find ourselves in awe of its amazing wealth and exotic resources, which shall now form the backbone of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] economy."

igk_mission_study_tamil_ship_design:0 "Study Tamil Ship Design"
igk_mission_study_tamil_ship_design_DESC:0 "The Tamil people are masters of the seas, and over the years have specially designed and built ships which are capable of traversing the vast Erythraean ocean. Now that we have conquered them, we should learn these legendary techniques from our subjects so that someday we may have an ocean-faring navy of our own."

igk_mission_expand_our_ports:0 "Construct New Ports"
igk_mission_expand_our_ports_DESC:0 "Throughout Dravida, there are dozens of prosperous seaside cities, yet many of them lack ports sufficient enough to receive incoming merchant vessels or house fleets. By building up the port facilities in these secondary cities, in addition to being able to receive more merchant vessels, we will be able to more quickly build up a fleet of our own."

igk_mission_establish_monsoon_markets:0 "Establish Monsoon Markets"
igk_mission_establish_monsoon_markets_DESC:0 "The Germanic peoples of our homeland have an annual tradition around the winter solstice, in which individual marketplaces are set up for people to buy goods and sell their wares. Although the solstice isn't celebrated quite that way here in Southern India, the monsoon winds bring merchant vessels to our harbors each year during the summer months; if we were to change our traditional markets to coincide with the onset of the monsoon winds, long-distance travelers would have more places to purchase local goods or sell their wares each season, thereby greatly increasing our trade."

igk_mission_an_ocean_going_navy:0 "An Ocean-going Navy"
igk_mission_an_ocean_going_navy_DESC:0 "Now that we have thoroughly studied Tamil ship-building techniques and significantly upgraded our port infrastructure, it is time for us to put our knowledge into practical use by building a massive fleet capable of giving the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] the ability to project its power and influence abroad." 

igk_mission_secure_indian_ocean_trade:0 "The Gateway to India"
igk_mission_secure_indian_ocean_trade_DESC:0 "The Maldives, while fairly resource-poor and depopulated, sit at a strategic point in-between in the Erythraean Sea safeguarding the way to India. By claiming these islands for our own, we will be able to secure all trade coming into Southern India."

igk_mission_purchase_the_isle_of_bliss:0 "Purchase the Isle of Bliss"
igk_mission_purchase_the_isle_of_bliss_DESC:0 "With the ability to project our power and influence abroad through our mighty navy, we can now look beyond the lands of India to enrich our empire back home; by establishing a naval base on the island of [GetProvince('(int32)7530').GetName], we will be able to profit off of ships on the other side of the Erythraean."

igk_mission_trade_posts_in_punt_DESC:0 "Although incredibly distant from our empire, the land of Punt sits on the western nexus of the vast Erythraean trade network connecting India to the western world. With our new naval bases, we now have the capacity to launch an overseas invasion to seize these important trade centers, and with both eastern and western nexuses under our control, we will have a complete monopoly over the entire Erythraean trade network!"

igk_mission_proclaim_empire:0 "An Indo-Germanic Empire"
igk_mission_proclaim_empire_DESC:0 "Years ago, we were but a small and negligible tribe living on the fringes of civilization in a land half a world away. Time-and-time again, we were told that greatness was far beyond our reach, yet, we still dreamt of glory and of a greater destiny for our people. Through harsh deserts, desolate plains, frozen tundra, and impregnable mountains, we marched all the way to India and proved our doubters wrong, yet time-and-time again, still the most learned of men refused to acknowledge our accomplishments. We destroyed Maurya, we crushed the Tamil kings, created a lasting cultural legacy, and achieved religious harmony. When nobody else gave us a second thought, we became the undisputed hegemons over all of India, silencing our doubters once-and-for-all, who now are forced to recognize our great Indo-Germanic Empire in all of its glory."

Now that we have begun integrating Indian customs, we can start the process of integrating our subjects into our kingdom."
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_200.a:0 "A good start."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_201_title:0 "Adopt Local Culinary Practices"
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_201_desc:0 "One of the major ways in which our culture differs from our Indian subjects is how we prepare our food, where they have learned to incorporate numerous hot and exotic spices as a measure to preserve meals for longer periods of time in this humid environment. Now that we have encouraged our people to try Indian-style dishes, we have gained a taste for spicy heat, with people around [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] savoring over bowls of Kadhi, or enjoying breakfast conversations over some Appam. Some, however, have even gone as far as to experiment their own dishes, such as a 'Haitazkasijaz,' or hot-cheese, made from cheese and Turmeric. With the adoption of their food, we have helped to bridge the gap between us and our subjects."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_206_desc:0 "After years of integrating and intermixing our people into Indic society, the lines between us and our subjects has blurred, making it difficult, if not impossible, for many to tell who is Germanic and who is Indian. Although the old guard will protest initially, we can now undergo the process to formally enshrine our mixture into law, and from there, the future will be ours to decide as a joint Indo-Germanic people."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_207_desc:0 "A year after our official proclamation, the paperwork has been formally completed, and even the most stubborn of our countrymen have accepted the obvious before them: A new culture has arisen through our interactions with the Indians, creating a fusion that no one in the sub-continent, nay, the world, could have ever foreseen coming. With the best of the Indic world and Germanic world fighting side-by-side, we will be unstoppable."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_108_desc:0 "Through our conquests, we have discovered a very rare and unusual spice the locals call 'Sugar', which adds sweet instead of heat to everything it coats. In fact, many who eat too much of it become highly energetic and excited before crashing out. With the select few areas capable of producing this substance in substantial quantity happening to fall under our control, now that we have ramped up production in those areas, we have established a complete monopoly on the sugar trade."

Although the solstice isn't celebrated quite that way here in Southern India, the monsoon winds bring merchant vessels to our harbors each year during the summer months; Now that we have changed our traditional markets to coincide with the onset of the monsoon winds, long-distance travelers have more places to purchase local goods or sell their wares each season, thereby greatly increasing our trade."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_310_desc:0 "There are many cities along the Erythraean shoreline, yet few are as well-developed as the great ports of the south, such as Koti and Satiyaputra. With our investment of significant resources into a single city, we have built a massive sea port, which, in-time, will become a major gateway to the west."

Now that we have established cities along the key transit points in the region, the legitimacy of our administration has been established, and even though the people are not happy with us, they now at least acknowledge our presence."
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_311.a:0 "In time, they will come to embrace our rule."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_312_title:0 "The West Coast"
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_312_desc:0 "Many ships traversing the great Erythraean pass by the western shoreline of Aparanta every year, granting whoever controls it a valuable and reliable source of revenue. Now that we save marched westward to seize the coast, we will be able to take our piece of this pie."
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_312.a:0 "Excellent."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_313_title:0 "The Great Jungle"
me_indo_germanic_kingdom_313_desc:0 "The great jungle tribes of Vindhyaprstha are skilled warriors who defend their homes with honor and valor. If we can tame these jungle-warriors, they would be a valuable addition to our armies."

me_indo_germanic_kingdom_999_desc:0 "Years ago, we were but a small and negligible tribe living on the fringes of civilization in a land half a world away. Time-and-time again, we were told that greatness was far beyond our reach, yet, we still dreamt of glory and of a greater destiny for our people. Through harsh deserts, desolate plains, frozen tundra, and impregnable mountains, we marched all the way to India and proved our doubters wrong, yet time-and-time again, still the most learned of men refused to acknowledge our accomplishments. We destroyed Maurya, crushed the Tamil kings, created a lasting cultural legacy, and achieved religious harmony. When nobody else gave us a second thought, we became the undisputed hegemons over all of India, silencing our doubters once-and-for-all, who now are forced to recognize our great Indo-Germanic Empire in all of its glory."
