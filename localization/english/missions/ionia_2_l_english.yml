 ionian_resurgence_2_DESCRIPTION:0 "After restoring the status of the Ionian cities and uniting this league of old, we must establish ourselves as a strong union. Granted, us ionians were never warmongers, so it crosses no-one's mind that we should be off to pointless wars to die in alien fields, we must try to be the cultural and economic hegemons of Greece and Asia. The Persians, Macedonians and whoever else tries their hand at us shall meet his due fate destitute, for we will ruin, and ridicule, them."
 ionian_resurgence_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission tree wil be considered complete once we have established our reach of all trade possible, and once we have become culturally dominant."

As such, when arriving in a new part of the world, the Ionian contingent should first establish contact with the peoples there, and if they are hospitable and open to trade, a base of operatoins, preferably in an island or along the coastline nearby.\n\nIt has quickly shaped military thought here, and leading experts predict it will allow us to procure trade goods in many more places, when comparing to where we'd be able to reach through pure conquest."
