 # Mission
 ionian_resurgence:0 "Ionian Resurgence"
 ionian_resurgence_DESCRIPTION:0 "As the identities of the various polises of Greece emerged, just after the time of Orpheus and Homer, the cities of Ionia shone the brightest. Driven by reason rather than superstition, our apogee only faded on account of the #E Lydians#!, when King Croesus conquered the region, falling subsequently to the #E Persians#!.\nNot content being a mere satrapy, Ionian heroes, our fathers and uncles, fought an almost impossible war against the might of the Persian armies. The spirits of those heroes shall help make Ionia think and act freely again, now from the chains of the #E Macedonians#!."
 ionian_resurgence_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This tree will be considered completed once we have regained our independence and formed the $IOU_FORMABLE_NAME$."

 # Tasks

 ionian_task_2:0 "Renovating [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]"
 ionian_task_2_DESC:0 "After years of foreign servitude, the once bustling cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1972').GetArea.GetName] are in total disrepair. Although some works are already in progress, we ought to do more than all others to stand above them."
 ionian_task_3:0 "Centre of Trade"
 ionian_task_3_DESC:0 "The once-bustling markets of our cities, the very ones that brought coinage to the world, are barren, so we must re-establish them."
 ionian_task_4:0 "Infiltrating our Overlord"
 ionian_task_4_DESC:0 "When dealing with such large armies, it is impossible to rely on meeting them on the field. We must use... other methods."
 ionian_task_5:0 "House of Learning"
 ionian_task_5_DESC:0 "Many philosophers and men of intellect left their mark not only on human knowledge, but on these cities, which they inhabited. Their superior knowledge will help us."
 ionian_task_6:0 "Rooting out Corruption"
 ionian_task_6_DESC:0 "With attempting a second Ionian Revolt, there is no space for failure, or treachery. Absolute loyalty on all walks of society is essential."
 ionian_task_7:0 "Grand Tour"
 ionian_task_7_DESC:0 "A Grand Tour of our capital is sure to impress our neighbours."
 ionian_task_9:0 "Rally the People"
 ionian_task_9_DESC:0 "Although Socrates was skeptical of popular support, we cannot hope to bring war to the Macedonians, and succeed, without the approval of the people."
 ionian_task_10:0 "Reaching Out"
 ionian_task_10_DESC:0 "There are other Ionian cities not in league with us, but surely just as eager for self-determination. We shall consult them on it."
 ionian_task_11:0 "Ionian Resurgence"
 ionian_task_11_DESC:0 "The mask has been lifted; [GetProvince('(int32)1972').GetArea.GetName] stands proud again among friends, far from strangers and enemies. It is time to rejoice!"
 ionian_task_12:0 "Muster the Troops"
 ionian_task_12_DESC:0 "Ionian soldiers were part of many great armies, but our cities always lacked military strength emanating from themselves."
 ionian_task_13:0 "Freedom or Death"
 ionian_task_13_DESC:0 "It has been enough time since the last time we tried, and enough time under servitude. The Ionian League will finally rule the Ionians!"
 ionian_task_14:0 "Mission to Rhodes"
 ionian_task_14_DESC:0 "As the Rhodians once resisted Antogonos and Demetrios, they will happily teach us to do so too."
 ionian_task_15:0 "Necessity is the Mother of Inventions"
 ionian_task_15_DESC:0 "[GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen] left some siegeworks around [GetProvince('(int32)266').GetName], we can study them and improve our siegecraft."

In orthoepy, without missing a syllable, he began by retelling the story of how #E Aristagoras of Miletos#! chose to inspire our cities to go to war against the Persians.\n\n''How would our grandfathers look at us in this disgraced age'' with a loud exclamation, he put the eyes of every citizen across the theater on him.''How would they regard us, indolent in our humiliation, and surrendered to those who stole our reins of servitude from those same Persians?! Are our homes mere feathers in the wind, blown elsewhere by those of brave mind? It must not be so! Citizens, go home and celebrate with your wives, children and friends, for today begins our fight.''\n\nThunderous roars of approval followed.

Immediately asking to speak in private, something quite unusual for an emissary from a friendly city, eyebrows are raised and suspicions felt.\n\nOnce all the servants and fellow statesmen had left, the messenger took a hefty breath and began explaining the recent political developments in [ionian_rebel_leader_scope.GetName], culminating in cries for independence everywhere. Naturally, this missive is highly sensitive, and we would not betray them so by sharing it with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetName]. Still, we should decide whether to join such a rebellion."

Regardless, this concentration of soldiers, even if a prelude to what might turn out to be military action, has had quite a positive effect for our army, and new structures of command have been implemented to smooth in the integration of such a large influx of fighters."
