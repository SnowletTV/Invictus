 ionian_resurgence:0 "Ionian Resurgence"
 ionian_resurgence_DESCRIPTION:0 "As the identities of the various polises of Greece emerged, just after the time of Orpheus and Homer, the cities of Ionia shone the brightest. Driven by reason rather than bellicosity, our apogee only faded on account of the #E Lydians#!, when King Croesus conquered the region, falling subsequently to the #E Persians#!.\nNot content being a mere satrapy, Ionian heroes, our fathers and uncles, fought an almost impossible war against the might of the Persian armies. The spirits of those heroes shall help make Ionia think and act freely again, now from the chains of the #E Macedonians#!."

 ionian_task_2_DESC:0 "After years of foreign servitude, the once bustling cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1972').GetArea.GetName] are in total disrepair. Although some works are already in progress, we ought to do more than all others to stand above them."
 ionian_task_3:0 "Centre of Trade"
 ionian_task_3_DESC:0 "The once-bustling markets of our cities, the very ones that brought coinage to the world, are barren, so we must re-establish them."
 ionian_task_4:0 "Infiltrating our Overlord"
 ionian_task_4_DESC:0 "When dealing with such large armies, it is impossible to rely on meeting them on the field. We must use... other methods."
 ionian_task_5:0 "House of Learning"
 ionian_task_5_DESC:0 "Many philosophers and men of intellect left their mark not only on human knowledge, but on these cities, which they inhabited. Their superior knowledge will help us."
 ionian_task_6:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
 ionian_task_6_DESC:0 "With attempting a second Ionian Revolt, there is no space for failure, or treachery. Absolute loyalty on all walks of society is essential."

Above him, by the candlelight, stands a man amazingly old, with a grim face and a severe look, almost that of an executioner.\n\n''[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], I am sure you know the traditions of this land very well.''\n''Indeed I do, why?''\n''Then you surely remember the Pan-Ionion, the holiest of gatherings between the men of these hills, where the governance of this coast was determined and where our games were held. I trust, then that under your leadership, all these men must gather at the foot of Mount Mykále, near [GetProvince('(int32)287').GetArea.GetName], at the sanctuary of Panionion, just like their forefathers. They look onto you from the world beyond, eager for you to ressurect their memory. You only need speak if you wish to oblige.''"

We are men and women of the arts, and of fine living, of trade, and of intellect, of luxury, and of oratory. As long as we exist, it shall be so."

In orthoepy, without missing a syllable, he began by retelling the story of how #E Aristagoras of Miletos#! chose to inspire our cities to go to war against the Persians.\n\n''How would our grandfathers look at us in this disgraced age'' with a loud exclamation, he put the eyes of every citizen across the theater on him.''How would they regard us, indolent in our humiliation, and surrendered to those who stole our reins of servitude from those same Persians?! Are our homes mere feathers in the wind, blown elsewhere by those of brave mind? It must not be so! Citizens, go home and celebrate with your wives, children and friends, for today begins our fight.''\n\nThunderous roars of approval followed. The people are demanding independence, and there is no going back."

Naturally, this missive is highly sensitive, and we would not betray them so by sharing it with the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetOverlord.GetAdjective]s. Still, we should decide whether to join such a rebellion."

 ionian_resurgence_event.7.desc:0 "Ever since the call from [SCOPE.sChar('ionian_orator_two').GetFirstName] to the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for war struck, something has awoken on the hearts of every Ionian, even though we were never much for warring: barracks were established for the gathering army just outside the city.\n\nMany men from the other parts of our country have gathered, ready to defend our just cause, even if some at a price. Regardless, this concentration of soldiers, even if a prelude to what might turn out to be military action, has had quite a positive effect for our army, and new structures of command have been implemented to smooth in the integration of such a large influx of fighters."
 ionian_resurgence_event.7.a:0 "The tide always starts rising slowly."

 ionian_resurgence_event.8.t:0 "Demands of Independence"
 ionian_resurgence_event.8.desc:0 "Those effeminate Ionians never cease in their decadent pursit of vice. Word today reaches us from [ionian_rebel_leader_scope.GetName], that preparations for war on us have been underway for months, despite them having nothing but our true friendship and protection.\n\nStill, they now demand that we grant them the independence they have done nothing to deserve, and that our troops steer well clear from their walls, ever again."
 ionian_resurgence_event.8.a:0 "We will take war to their precious little homes."
 ionian_resurgence_event.8.b:0 "We have no choice but to release them."

 ionian_resurgence_event.9.t:0 "$ionian_task_14$"
 ionian_resurgence_event.9.desc:0 "It seems our exploits in the #E Siege of [GetProvince('(int32)266').GetName]#! still earn us quite the reputation and recognition. [SCOPE.sC('rhodes_ionian').GetName] has asked that we share our supposed great secrets on how to defeat the banal armies of [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen].\n\nIt is up to us to decide if we ought to help this nation in need."

I'll tell you what I want and you can get it for me, as I am here to present my services.\n\nNow, I am aware you aren't the most bellicose around, and, naturally I saw plenty of improvements to be made on my way to this tent. So, first of all, the training of the infantry is quite lackluster...''"

 ionian_resurgence_event.11.t:0 "Rhodian Support"
 ionian_resurgence_event.11.desc:0 "The Rhodians, wisened by their past, have accepted to help us, a more intellectual nation, in the ways of war, that will surely come to us.\n\nIt is clear that our artistic ways wouldn't be enough to win a conflict (though our artists will certainly help with their paramount creativity), and we now stand more confident."
 ionian_resurgence_event.11.a:0 "Thank the gods!"

 ionian_resurgence_event.12.t:0 "Rhodian Refusal"
 ionian_resurgence_event.12.desc:0 "It seems hubris has couped the Rhodian government and now rules alone. How is it that they, besieged by these tyrants, refuse help to others who find themselves in the exact same situation? At least, we rest assured that we will sing their vice to all corners of the hellenic world.\n\nWe will have to rely on our creativity and idealism to find new ways to wage war."
 ionian_resurgence_event.12.a:0 "We stand alone."

 ionian_resurgence_event.13.t:0 "$ionian_task_3$"
 ionian_resurgence_event.13.desc:0 "Ionia, the crossroads between Asia and Greece, is known as a land of traders and merchants. We almost faltered in keeping up that reputation, but riches flow  once again through our wise hands.\n\nNew enterprises are formed throughout our cities, ready to ship any type of good wherever (even well beyond the respectable, civilized world!) Truly, to trade and make contacts between foreign peoples defines us in ways it doesn't to many; we must we proud of our cosmopolitan nature."

 ionian_resurgence_event.14.desc:0 "We are nowhere near the centres of culture we once were, so dominant in the Greek world, taking our own paths in the intellectual arts, to be followed in a hurry by the other Greeks, ever in fear of falling behind the standard we set in being a cultured and scientific society and not some ''Bar-bar'' spewing tribals.\n\nIt will be a long time until we regain that scientific upper-hand, although nowadays we do produce some great minds, but we fail to give them the proper resources to shine much alike the stars some of them study."

 ionian_resurgence_event.18.desc:0 "Though many insist on painting the Ionians as decadent and hedonistic, the truth is we merely enjoy the fineries of life better than others, and they resent us for it. To enjoy, however, does not imply overindulging, something many government officials took the pleasures of partaking in.\n\nThankfully, these wretches now run hills away or rot in our prisons with disgraced names and denounced visages. The leading figures in our society have helped make this point by introducing some sort of bucolic virtue as the new fashion.
