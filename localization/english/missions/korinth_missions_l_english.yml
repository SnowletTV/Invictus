After the Trojan War, Idomenus's ships hit a terrible storm. Fearing for his life, Idomenus promised to Poseidon that he would sacrifice the first living thing he saw when he returned to Crete. In a cruel twist of fate, when Idomenus returned, the first thing he saw was his son. Upon murdering his son, the gods, angered by his acts, sent a plague to Crete. It was then that the Cretans exiled him to Italy, where he founded the city of Kallipolis. The inhabitants of Kallipolis are Messapian, but they share many similarities to the Greeks, especially in religion. In later times, Kallipolis came under the rule of the Korinthians, who expanded the ancient city. Under this rule, the Kallipolitans began to act more like their Achaean overlords."

In addition to the annual festival dedicated to the hero that is celebrated every year, there is also athletic games held every five years.
