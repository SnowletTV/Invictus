01_legia: "Flight of the Eagles"
01_legia_DESCRIPTION: "Legia represents a loose collection of 26 local tribes of Lezgic origin. The Lezgi maintain close cultural and religious connections with the children of Durdzuks, the early Ingush and Chechen peoples, as well as the tribes of Caucasian Albania to the south. Pinned between the nomadic Iranian steppe hordes to the north and the encroaching Helleno-Iranian empires south of the mountains, the inhabitants of Legia have had to adopt foriegn elements while trying to maintain their mountain traditions. It will only be their cooperation with their neighbors, and their tenacity, which will save their future from damnation to the periphery of the history books."
01_legia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "The mission will be complete when Legia has come to dominate the Caucasian Mountains and can ensure the mountain peoples' safety for the foreseeable future."

01_legia_task_1: "The Djaamats"
01_legia_task_1_DESC: "For too long have the djaamats, the great Lezgic clans, fought one another over hillside territory and simple feuds. If the cycle of moon and sun continues to circle around these petty squabbles, the 26 tribes will tear each other apart. Unite the tribes!"

01_legia_task_3_DESC: "While the great clans now walk in step, individual families still clash between individual hurs (villages).

01_legia_task_5: "Steppe Relations"
01_legia_task_5_DESC: "A constant threat, but also a source of mysteries and rich trade luxuries, the horselords to the north often wander Lezgic lands. It would do the people good to obtain some friends among their nomadic tribes. Perhaps more interesting characters will join our villages."

01_legia_task_6_DESC: "The town straddling the divide between the empires of the south and the endless expanses of the north. We must control this linchpin in international trade!"

01_legia_task_8_DESC: "The Ghalgai, having stated their hard differences from the Lezgi and the cause of all those sons of Durdzuks and his ilk, seek to make their own path in history. The Lezgi should decide whether to accompany them or to cut ties."

01_legia_task_10_DESC: "The lake waters are not familiar to us, but their bounties are unmistakable, representing a window into other worlds are people have no stories for. We must sieze these golden shores and reap the benefits of virgin trade."

01_legia_task_12_DESC: "Among the denizens of Caucasian Albania are many Lezgic tribes and peoples, both long-lived and recently migrated. With a burgeoning Lezgic state on the rise, it would do us well to call these people home, to a strong and united Legia."

01_legia_task_13: "The Mazandaran Trade Metropolis"
01_legia_task_13_DESC: "Daraband, the economic node of the north, the only bustling place in the mountains, needs to be cared for.

01_legia_task_14: "Eastern Caucasian Union"
01_legia_task_14_DESC: "Emissaries from over the mountains are treating in the elders' homes after shopping in our markets. Word has spread far and wide.

01_legia_task_15: "Lezgic Supremacy"
01_legia_task_15_DESC: "The eagle sours over endless Lezgi skies, beating the air like a drum. It is time to elevate our people and enter a new era of the mountains' history!"

01_legia_task_16: "Raiding the South Caucasus"
01_legia_task_16_DESC: "The kingdoms inhabiting the southern ridges of Kavkasos' mountains have always flaunted their great wealth, often in the faces of our kind. It would do us well to knock them down a peg and remind them the strength of village folk."

01_legia_task_17: "The North Caucasian Lands"
01_legia_task_17_DESC: "Many in the lands surrounding have lineages intertwined with our own. The hero tales speak of ventures far and wide to the great swamp of the west and the river cutting into the ever-north. All these realms can be considered the lezgic homeland, so conquer it and reinstate it as a land of heroes and great deeds."

Those around him say that he is a genius in his field, but that his personality and tastes leave things to be desired... /n/nShall we have him stay in the capital in order to train cohorts of great Lezgic merchants?"

Requesting an audince with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], he presented a blue rock and, in his other hand, a beautiful blue necklace. A true salesman, he weaved tales of kings and princesses and emperors wearing such wares in the east and the south, and asked why our esteemed chiefs had nothing so fancy. When it was made clear that we did not know the substance he, oh so generously, offered to regularly supply it to Zabender in great quantity for a regular fee. Most of the chiefs were swayed by his pitch, and are now seeking to agree to his demands. What shall be done?"

As such, they say that, should we cut ties completely, they shall compensate us. However, they realize that their subserviance and reliance on Zabender is inevitable, so they are willing to accept our detached dominion."

me_legia_16_desc: "Now that the Lezgic people have formed a great kingdom, many of the elders, remembering the times of old when the Achaemenids ruled the Kavkasos range, claim that a fitting title for our great ruler should borrow from the tradition and prestige of the empire of old which lasted for so many years. From here on, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] shall be known as the Kirsan Shah."

me_legia_17_desc: "While many of the Lezgic tribes in Caucasian Albania have migrated to their true homeland, bolstering our population and economy, many still chose to remain in the villages they'd spent their lives building up. However, messengers from tribal chiefs south of the mountains have approached us with a dangerous but enticing prospect. While those tribes who remained in their homes do not wish to leave their valleys, they have grown tired of the Albanian rule and wish to rise up and turn the lands into a component of our realm instead. Shall we pursue this offer?"
me_legia_17.a: "We must free all Lezgic peoples."
me_legia_17.b: "The situation with Caucasian Albania is stable - let it stay that way."

me_legia_18_title: "Daraband Builders"
me_legia_18_desc: "While Daraband has been strengthened as a bastion of the Lezgic realm, the great builders who expanded the city have come forward with the prospect of giving Zabender the same treatment, for a price, of course. Many of the elders feel that assisting Zabender's grow, and creating a twin-cities situation for the Lezgic nation, should allow greater prosperity and stability for all the tribes. Shall this great undertaking be pursued?"
me_legia_18.a: "The expense is too great."
me_legia_18.b: "We shall build two great games north of the mountains!"

me_legia_19_title: "Forming a Lezgic Union"
me_legia_19_desc: "With both northern and southern peaks of the Kavkasos range bordering the Mazandaran Sea udner our rule, trade, military exercises, and communication have become stronger than ever before. Many non-Lezgic people have come under our soverignty or have allied with us against invaders. There may be some benefit in reorienting our people outwards, presenting ourselves as partners in a union of many tribes, so as not to create unecessary enemies beyond the mountains. What say you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]?"

me_legia_21_desc: "As the raiding party enters the modern Assa Gorge, the last village they reach before the mountain pass holds a shrine to the sun, to the great god Gal.

me_legia_22_title: "Forward Scouts"
me_legia_22_desc: "As the warband has made its way through the mountain passes, with the Iberi lands almost inside, the commanders of the raiding part y have met to discuss strategy. Some feel that a complete surprise, like the tactics of a horde-raid, would be the most successful because of the imminence-factor. However, others feel that sending forward scouts to raid, burn, and pillage the initial territory will leave local garrisons in a panic and provide better information on the area, helping the raid's success. What shall be done?"
me_legia_22.a: "Scouts shall be sent."
