01_legia: "Flight of the Eagles"
01_legia_DESCRIPTION: "Legia represents a loose collection of 26 local tribes of Lezgic origin. The Lezgi maintain close cultural and religious connections with the children of Durdzuks, the early Ingush and Chechen peoples, as well as the tribes of Caucasian Albania to the south. Pinned between the nomadic Iranian steppe hordes to the north and the encroaching Helleno-Iranian empires south of the mountains, the inhabitants of Legia have had to adopt foriegn elements while trying to maintain their mountain traditions. It will only be their cooperation with their neighbors, and their tenacity, which will save their future from damnation to the periphery of the history books."
01_legia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "The mission will be complete when Legia has come to dominate the Caucasian Mountains and can ensure the mountain peoples' safety for the foreseeable future." 
01_legia_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Take Flight!"

#Missions

01_legia_task_1: "The Djaamats"
01_legia_task_1_DESC: "For too long have the djaamats, the great Lezgic clans, fought one another over hillside territory and simple feuds. If the cycle of moon and sun continues to circle around these petty squabbles, the 26 tribes will tear each other apart. Unite the tribes!"
01_legia_task_1_tt: "Every #Y clan chief#! has a #E loyalty#! greater than #G 75#!."

01_legia_task_2: "The Language of Merchants"
01_legia_task_2_DESC: "Should the people ever wish to furbish their huts and villages with even base trinkets, they must connect with the network of merchants which act as a window to the worlds beyond. Let us train our people in the ways of coin."

01_legia_task_3: "Unity of Syhils and Hurs"
01_legia_task_3_DESC: "While the great clans now walk in step, individual families still clash between individual hurs (villages). Boys and girls can recall their matrilineal and patrilineal heritage, their syhils, going back at least 7 generations. Show them that all families of the djaamats are connected. Intermarriage should strengthen their bonds."
01_legia_task_3_tt: "#Y Legia#! has enacted the #Y Cultural Decision#! called #Y Land Ownership Protection#! for the #Y Legian#! culture."
01_legia_task_3_tt2: "We must have #Y 4#! #T Clan Chiefs#! with a loyalty of at least #E 65#!."

01_legia_task_4: "The Ghalghai Peoples"
01_legia_task_4_DESC: "The Ghalghai, known at times as the Gelae tribes, have been sword-kin as much as thorns Lezgic sides. It is time to learn how to manage this troublesome relationship. During the talks with their leaders, it would be best to approach following the rules stipulate by lezgiwal."
01_legia_task_4_tt: "The [GetCulture('gelaean').GetName] culture is integrated."

01_legia_task_5: "Steppe Relations"
01_legia_task_5_DESC: "A constant threat, but also a source of mysteries and rich trade luxuries, the horselords to the north often wander Lezgic lands. It would do the people good to obtain some friends among their nomadic tribes. Perhaps more interesting characters will join our villages."

01_legia_task_6: "Daraband Trade"
01_legia_task_6_DESC: "The town straddling the divide between the empires of the south and the endless expanses of the north. We must control this linchpin in international trade!"

01_legia_task_7: "A Royal Miresar"
01_legia_task_7_DESC: "In a society of tightly-wound family trees, it is difficult to identify a clear leading bloodline. However, if the Lezgi are to bind themselves together, they will need a great king. Thus, we must search the lineages for and pronounce a royal line, a royal miresar."

01_legia_task_8: "A Ghalghai Confederation"
01_legia_task_8_DESC: "The Ghalgai, having stated their hard differences from the Lezgi and the cause of all those sons of Durdzuks and his ilk, seek to make their own path in history. The Lezgi should decide whether to accompany them or to cut ties."

01_legia_task_9: "Lezgic Hegemony"
01_legia_task_9_DESC: "It has become clear that, in order to unite all the tribes and maintain stability in the new realm, the Lezgi must seek to lord over all those other peoples who call Kavkasos' northern mountains home."

01_legia_task_10_DESC: "The lake waters are not familiar to us, but their bounties are unmistakable, representing a window into other worlds are people have no stories for. We must sieze these golden shores and reap the benefits of virgin trade."

01_legia_task_11_DESC: "To enshrine our history into the hero sagas, we must forge the first kingdom of the Lezgi. Pronounce the new royal symbols and hail the hero-king and queen!"

01_legia_task_12: "Albanian Lezgi"
01_legia_task_12_DESC: "Among the denizens of Caucasian Albania are many Lezgic tribes and peoples, both long-lived and recently migrated. With a burgeoning Lezgic state on the rise, it would do us well to call these people home, to a strong and united Legia."

01_legia_task_13: "The Mazandaran Trade Metropolis"
01_legia_task_13_DESC: "Daraband, the economic node of the north, the only bustling place in the mountains, needs to be cared for.

01_legia_task_14: "Eastern Caucasian Union"
01_legia_task_14_DESC: "Emissaries from over the mountains are treating in the elders' homes after shopping in our markets. Word has spread far and wide.

01_legia_task_15_DESC: "The eagle sours over endless Lezgi skies, beating the air like a drum. It is time to elevate our people and enter a new era of the mountains' history!"

01_legia_task_16: "Raiding the South Caucasus"
01_legia_task_16_DESC: "The kingdoms inhabiting the southern ridges of Kavkasos' mountains have always flaunted their great wealth, often in the faces of our kind. It would do us well to knock them down a peg and remind them the strength of village folk."

01_legia_task_17: "The North Caucasian Lands"
01_legia_task_17_DESC: "Many in the lands surrounding have lineages intertwined with our own. The hero tales speak of ventures far and wide to the great swamp of the west and the river cutting into the ever-north. All these realms can be considered the lezgic homeland, so conquer it and reinstate it as a land of heroes and great deeds."

Requesting an audince with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], he presented a blue rock and, in his other hand, a beautiful blue necklace. A true salesman, he weaved tales of kings and princesses and emperors wearing such wares in the east and the south, and asked why our esteemed chiefs had nothing so fancy. When it was made clear that we did not know the substance he, oh so generously, offered to regularly supply it to Zabender in great quantity for a regular fee.
