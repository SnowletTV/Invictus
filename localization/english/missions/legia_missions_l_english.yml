 01_legia_DESCRIPTION:0 "Legia represents a loose collection of 26 local tribes of Lezgic origin. The Lezgi maintain close cultural and religious connections with the children of Durdzuks, the early Ingush and Chechen peoples, as well as the tribes of Caucasian Albania to the south. Pinned between the nomadic Iranian steppe hordes to the north and the encroaching Helleno-Iranian empires south of the mountains, the inhabitants of Legia have had to adopt foriegn elements while trying to maintain their mountain traditions. It will only be their cooperation with their neighbors, and their tenacity, which will save their future from damnation to the periphery of the history books."

 01_legia_task_17:0 "The North Caucasian Lands"
 01_legia_task_17_DESC:0 "Many in the lands surrounding have lineages intertwined with our own.

Those around him say that he is a genius in his field, but that his personality and tastes leave things to be desired... /n/nShall we have him stay in the capital in order to train cohorts of great Lezgic merchants?"

Claiming to hail from the city of Bactra, he noted the surprising lack of rich minerals and metals in our markets. Sifting through the ordinary gold and silver, and even the rare gems, he looked displeased and unimpressed. Requesting an audince with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], he presented a blue rock and, in his other hand, a beautiful blue necklace. A true salesman, he weaved tales of kings and princesses and emperors wearing such wares in the east and the south, and asked why our esteemed chiefs had nothing so fancy. When it was made clear that we did not know the substance he, oh so generously, offered to regularly supply it to Zabender in great quantity for a regular fee. Most of the chiefs were swayed by his pitch, and are now seeking to agree to his demands. What shall be done?"

As such, they say that, should we cut ties completely, they shall compensate us. However, they realize that their subserviance and reliance on Zabender is inevitable, so they are willing to accept our detached dominion."

However, messengers from tribal chiefs south of the mountains have approached us with a dangerous but enticing prospect. While those tribes who remained in their homes do not wish to leave their valleys, they have grown tired of the Albanian rule and wish to rise up and turn the lands into a component of our realm instead.

Some feel that a complete surprise, like the tactics of a horde-raid, would be the most successful because of the imminence-factor. However, others feel that sending forward scouts to raid, burn, and pillage the initial territory will leave local garrisons in a panic and provide better information on the area, helping the raid's success.
