 #Missions
 
maeotian_missions_task_01: "The Eastern Bosporans"
maeotian_missions_task_01_DESC: "In the last few centuries, the Bosporan Kingdom's dynasty has encroached evermore eastwards, enveloping our territory and blocking us from accessing the lake we share our cultural heritage with. We must make a deal to return to those lands."
maeotian_missions_task_01_tt: "A #Y negotiation#! will start with the #T Bosporan Kingdom#! to decide the fate of its #Y Eastern Maeotic#! territories."

maeotian_missions_task_02: "Fish for the Future"
maeotian_missions_task_02_DESC: "The Maeotian tribes of the lake live off of its bounty, so a wealth of fishing is needed in order to sustain the kind of growth our tribes seek."
#maeotian_missions_task_02_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_03: "Maeotian Authority"
maeotian_missions_task_03_DESC: "To maintain an independence from the Bosporans and prevent subjugation from the Sarmatians, the Maeotes need to establish a sense of authority in the region. Traditions and structures must become organized practices between the tribes."
#maeotian_missions_task_03_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_04: "Trade in Tanais"
maeotian_missions_task_04_DESC: "Set at the mouth of a river headed into the unknown north, Tanais is one of the last points of connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Scythian lands. In order to control the trade of grain, slaves, and exotic eastern goods, we should take up this old port and revive it."
maeotian_missions_task_04_tt: "Have a fleet of at least #G 15#! ships on the River Tanais (the #T highlighted#! province near the port of Tanais)."

maeotian_missions_task_05: "Cities of the Maeotes"
maeotian_missions_task_05_DESC: "The increase in births within the tribes have overcrowded the villages - greater settlements are needed to accomodate the greater realm of the Maeotians."
#maeotian_missions_task_05_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_06: "Maeotian Diplomacy"
maeotian_missions_task_06_DESC: "Warding off the expansionist Bosporans and the raiding Sarmatians is going to require making some friends among the north Caucasian tribes."
#maeotian_missions_task_06_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_07: "Swamp Training"
maeotian_missions_task_07_DESC: "Both a natural barrier and a rough terrain to conquer, the Maeotic Swamp presents the greatest of training fields a Maeotian warrior can hope to master. Let the men engage in mock combat there, and no stretch of the world shall ever challenge them again."
#maeotian_missions_task_07_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_08: "Trade Routes into Hyperborea"
maeotian_missions_task_08_DESC: "There lie some legendary cities far into the steppe lands, like Gelon, which is at times called Helon. The Greek traders and steppe nomads speak of the lands up north as a place of mystery and wonder. Perhaps it would be beneficial to extend our connections up that way."
#maeotian_missions_task_08_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_09: "Developing the Maeotic Swamp"
maeotian_missions_task_09_DESC: "While the swampy nature of the Maeotic Lake's shores have before been a defensive wall of mother nature, it also prevents the Maeotian tribes from developing magnificent ports - draining portions of it and erecting great cities should change our fortunes."
#maeotian_missions_task_09_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_10: "Malhk Kingdom"
maeotian_missions_task_10_DESC: "Oral tradition speaks of a kingdom, Malhk, which once existed when all the Maeotian tribes were unified under a single royal family and a single banner. To signal our renewed unity, the kingdom must once again be formed."
#maeotian_missions_task_10_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_11: "Marsh Mercenaries"
maeotian_missions_task_11_DESC: "Many nomadic bands live among the marshes of the Maeotic. Among them are several elite warriors whom the tribes have attempted to bribe in order to patrol the border regions with the Sarmatians to the north. These dangerous individuals must be under our control."
#maeotian_missions_task_11_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_12: "A Maeotian Empire"
maeotian_missions_task_12_DESC: "Control of the Maeotic coasts has made us masters of the lake, with the Pontos Euxinos awaiting as our next playground of conquest and influence. No longer a backwater tribal land, the Maeotians must become a historic people of the north!"
#maeotian_missions_task_12_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_13: "Tighten the Sindic Grip"
maeotian_missions_task_13_DESC: "The many Maeotian subtribes are restless, creating problems for the Sindioi who have bigger political fish to fry. Let them learn their place, by force if necessary."
#maeotian_missions_task_13_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_14: "Inviting Octamasades Back"
maeotian_missions_task_14_DESC: "Chased into the lands of the Scythians by the Bosporans, many supporters of the usurper, Octamasades of the Sindoi, remain. Perhaps strength would return to our tribal identity should he be brought back from exile and reinstated upon the throne."
#maeotian_missions_task_14_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_15: "Recapturing Sindia"
maeotian_missions_task_15_DESC: "Now Gorgippa, the original capital of the Sindoi, Sindia, remains a sore spot for the people who fled their homes long ago. Vengeance must be taken against the Greek invaders!"

#maeotian_missions_task_16_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_17: "Adopting Steppe Traditions"
maeotian_missions_task_17_DESC: "The Scythian and Sarmatian tribes inspire a greater fear in the Greeks and imperial powers than any tribe elsewhere. It would do the Sindoi good to adopt their practices and become formidable as well."
#maeotian_missions_task_17_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_18: "A Helleno-Maeotic Kingdom"
maeotian_missions_task_18_DESC: "Embracing the Greek world, the Sindoi can maneuver to inherit the whole of the Bosporan Kingdom - let the children of Hecataeus engage in a battle of political intrigue."
#maeotian_missions_task_18_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_19: "Overthrow the Sindii"
maeotian_missions_task_19_DESC: "Both benefactor and oppressor, the Sindoi led us against the Bosporans while stealing our women and children as the dominant tribe. They must be done away with in order to usher in a new order of things."

maeotian_missions_task_20: "A New Leading Tribe"
maeotian_missions_task_20_DESC: "The downfall of the Maeotian cause has long been their disunity - selecting a single tribe to lead should solve the matter of a disorganized state."

maeotian_missions_task_21: "Apollo and the Labrytai"
maeotian_missions_task_21_DESC: "Following their victory at Labrys, the Bosporans enshrined the worship of Apollo in the new city and its influence has spread radially. The city must become a Maeotian bastion instead."
#maeotian_missions_task_21_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_22: "Tower of Tirgatao"
maeotian_missions_task_22_DESC: "Hecataeus' tower, which once held our queen Tirgatao, should be renewed as a symbol of protection and authority among the tribes of the Maeotae."
#maeotian_missions_task_22_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_23: "Promoting Phanagoria"
maeotian_missions_task_23_DESC: "Along the eastern Maeotis, Phanagoria stands out as the main center of trade, rivaling Panticapaeum. In our hands, the port city must become a means of controlling entry into the lake."
#maeotian_missions_task_23_tt: "________."

maeotian_missions_task_24: "Maeotian Kurgan Burial"
maeotian_missions_task_24_DESC: "The Scythians and Sarmatians honor their dead royals with great burial mounds which tower above towns and cities, as if the land itslef had risen to mark their greatness. If the Maeotians should be treated so well, we must adopt the traditions of respected peoples."
