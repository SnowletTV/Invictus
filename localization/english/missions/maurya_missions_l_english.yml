mauryan_collapse_prevention:0 "Prevent Collapse"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_DESCRIPTION:0 "Ashoka ascends to the throne during a difficult time. Two of our Rajas have died in unfortunate events, leaving our country in a state of decline. Many political figures within our realm are disloyal and serve only their own interests, abandoning their oaths to us. Adding to that, our neighbors look upon us like hungry beasts, waiting for a sign of weakness. Maurya mustn't fall. Maurya will not fall! . '#R If Ashoka dies before completing the missions they will no longer be available and Maurya will collapse#!"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Ashoka has solidified his rule and the Mauryan dynasties position is safe."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Hopefully we are successful..."

#Mission Tasks
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_1:0 "Ashoka the Great"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_1_desc:0 "Ashoka is the son of Bindusara and grandson of Chandragupta himself. He is of royal descendance and appears to be much more competent than his late father. And even though his rise to the throne has not been without blood, with him as our leader, we may survive these trying times."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_2:0 "Consolidate Pracya"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_2_desc:0 "Pracya has long been the seat of power for us. Restoring order to our capital is essential for our survival."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_3:0 "Chandashoka"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_3_desc:0 "Ashoka rules with an iron fist. He shows' no mercy towards his enemies, regardless of whether they hail from foreign lands or come from within his vast realm. His means are often cruel, but efficient. Many have started to call him Chandashoka, meaning Ashoka the Cruel, behind his back."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_4:0 "Grand Campaigns of Ashoka"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_4_desc:0 "Raja Ashoka does not just seem highly competent in matters of state, but also in matters of military. He will prove his martial prowess to the world, so that they will all feel our true might."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_5:0 "The Destruction of the Kalingas"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_5_desc:0 "Kalinga lies to the south and has long tried to resist our hegemony over India. Ashoka will be the one to finally make them kneel before us."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_6:0 "The Buddhist monk Samudra"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_6_desc:0 "The citizens are speaking of a highly suspicious individual within our city. A certain monk named Samudra preaches his ways to our people. He could turn out to be a danger, or a chance."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_7:0 "Appease the Governors"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_7_desc:0 "One man cannot rule all of Maurya alone. Many others are needed to keep the realm in order. And these people must be kept happy."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_8:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_8_desc:0 "Our Governors have become increasingly corrupt and disloyal. We must regain their trust if we want to retain our empire!"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_9:0 "Prevent Collapse"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_9_desc:0 "Ashoka may just have done the impossible. With a show of true understanding of court politics, he stabilized our country. The past years have been rough, but now we may be able to put these times behind us."
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_10:0 "Support the Buddhist Faith"
mauryan_collapse_prevention_task_10_desc:0 "The Buddhist faith is, as of right now, only a small proportion of our populace. But their teachings are invaluable for us. The old gods have failed us and it is time to look towards a new beacon."

##Second Mission tree
mauryan_reconquest:0 "Magadhi Revival"
mauryan_reconquest_DESCRIPTION:0 "Our great kingdom lies in ruins. Our past few rulers could not prevent the downfall of our nation. Not even the great Ashoka, in whom we put so much trust, could end our struggle for a consolidated Maurya. Now we are weak and but a shadow of our former self. If we wish to regain our status as a major power in India, we must become strong again! "
mauryan_reconquest_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed once you have reclaimed all of the lands lost after the death of Ashoka."
mauryan_reconquest_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Towards glory of times past!"

mauryan_reconquest_task_1:0 "Magadhi Revival"
mauryan_reconquest_task_1_desc:0 "Maurya is no longer the behemoth it was during the reign of Chandragupta. We have shrunken in power and influence throughout India, but our spirits are as high as ever. We mustn't go down without a fight!"
mauryan_reconquest_task_2:0 "Shungan Destruction"
mauryan_reconquest_task_2_desc:0 "The Shungan have used our time of temporary weakness to become a major power within our previous realm. Their decadence is sickening and their arrogance an insult towards us - we cannot tolerate their presence for another day. We must crush them."
mauryan_reconquest_task_3:0 "Challenge Satavahana"
mauryan_reconquest_task_3_desc:0 "Satavahana is one of the many powers that sprung up after our fracture. Still, they are weak. We may be able to move diplomatically and secure our lost land without bloodshed."
mauryan_reconquest_task_4:0 "The Indo-Greek Question"
mauryan_reconquest_task_4_desc:0 "The Greeks in Bactria and Persia have long been a nuisance for us. But now, damnable fates, there is even Greek influence within our former western provinces, a development that we should not tolerate. Though they are not considered a primary target of interest, gaining influence in the regions that they are infiltrating might prove profitable for us."
mauryan_reconquest_task_5:0 "Mauryan Revival"
mauryan_reconquest_task_5_desc:0 "We have lost much of our strength during the last events, but now we are growing powerful again. Our enemies shall cower before us; we will reclaim what was once ours!"
mauryan_reconquest_task_6:0 "Magadhi Influence"
mauryan_reconquest_task_6_desc:0 "The recent losses of our dominions scattered our people into different kingdoms all over northern India. Reuniting our populace is of utmost importance for our revival, for what do we have if we do not have our people?"
mauryan_reconquest_task_7:0 "Building Our Legacy"
mauryan_reconquest_task_7_desc:0 "We are not done yet! And we will prove it to the whole world. Building up our cities will show everyone that we are still a force to be reckoned with."
mauryan_reconquest_task_8:0 "Into the Jungle"
mauryan_reconquest_task_8_desc:0 "The jungles of India are a harsh and unforgiving place. Wild animals and uncivilised tribes live within these dangerous biomes. However, we are destined for greatness, and even the forces of nature will be subdued by our arms."
mauryan_reconquest_task_9:0 "Dominate Aparanta"
mauryan_reconquest_task_9_desc:0 "To the west lies the region of Aparanta. It is the gateway into the Arabian Sea and the Hellenistic kings in Syria and Egypt. "
mauryan_reconquest_task_10:0 "Push South"
mauryan_reconquest_task_10_desc:0 "After the untimely death of Raja Ashoka, Dravidia and Karnata were lost. These provinces have always been an important anchor for Mauryan dominance and we will take them back."

mauryan_reconquest_task_12:0 "Ports of the West"
mauryan_reconquest_task_12_desc:0 "The western coast of India brings many chances for economic growth. Just beyond the sea lies the fertile regions of Arabia and Mesopotamia, with markets that are the envy of all who see them. Many ports will be needed if we want to trade with them efficiently."
mauryan_reconquest_task_13:0 "The Metropolis of Pataliputra"
mauryan_reconquest_task_13_desc:0 "Pataliputra is the seat of our power, and as such, should reflect our strength. Building it up will set an important stone for our revival."
mauryan_reconquest_task_14:0 "Pracyan Silk"
mauryan_reconquest_task_14_desc:0 "Silk is one of the best selling products on the current market. Merchants travel far and wide to get a hand on the valuable fabric. Establishing a monopoly on this product would make them all come to us, no?"
mauryan_reconquest_task_15:0 "Mauryan Trade Networks"
mauryan_reconquest_task_15_desc:0 "Trade is what makes India rich. Its natural resources, abundance of food, and exotic goods are highly valued in the lands to the west. Expanding upon our trade network could help us to build up our economy."
mauryan_reconquest_task_16:0 "Granary of India"
mauryan_reconquest_task_16_desc:0 "The backbone of our nation has, and always will be, its people. Without them, who are we to rule over? Our kingdom is high in population, therefore, much food will be needed."
mauryan_reconquest_task_17:0 "Dravidian Dominance"
mauryan_reconquest_task_17_desc:0 "Dravidia escaped our control after the death of Ashoka. Restoring our dominance over these lands will show them that Maurya is not to be underestimated."
mauryan_reconquest_task_18:0 "Into Karnata"
mauryan_reconquest_task_18_desc:0 "Karnata has always been a place of interest for our kingdom. Even Chandragupta had plans of invasion for it. "
mauryan_reconquest_task_19:0 "Reincorporate Taxila"

#Flavor Events
flavor_maurya_1_title:"Death of Chandragupta" 
flavor_maurya_1_desc:0 "Our pious Raja, Chandragupta, has fully embraced the teachings of Jainism, choosing to starve his earthly body to death so that his soul might blossom. Many within the court are still shocked, and some are calling for a long period of mourning before settling the succession. However, our many enemies will take note and we must act quickly; Bindusara, eldest son of Chandragupta, will be the new Raja."
flavor_maurya_1.a:0 "May he rest easy."

flavor_maurya_2_title:"Bhadrabahu the Jain" 
flavor_maurya_2_desc:0 "Our illustrious court attracts many traveling holy men; some seek to proselytize, sharing the teachings of their Masters in hopes of gaining new followers, and many simply ask for alms before passing through to the next city. But today is different; a Jain monk named Bhadrabahu, known throughout the land for his many writings, has arrived in our palace and King Chandragupta has shown much interest in him. Perhaps his teachings could help us in our strive to greatness?"
flavor_maurya_2.a:0 "Bring him into court"
flavor_maurya_2.b:0 "Maurya is not Jain!"

flavor_maurya_3_title:"Jain Teachings" 
flavor_maurya_3_desc:0 "Bhadrabahu, the Jain monk that recently joined our court, has been teaching every morning. Even Chandragupta himself ventures down into the courtyard after sunrise, taking a seat amongst the listeners, and the conversations between Monk and Raja lasts for many hours, often past the midday meal. Many are starting to believe that Jain ways of thinking are worth considering. If we were to preach them throughout our kingdom, perhaps we could profit from it somehow."
flavor_maurya_3.a:0 "Begin to embrace Jain values in the realm"
flavor_maurya_3.b:0 "Maurya is and always will be Hindu!"
flavor_maurya_3.tt:0 "Bhadrabahu will leave and head south..."

flavor_maurya_5_title:"The death of Bindusara" 
flavor_maurya_5_desc:0 "In a terrible chain of events our Raja, Bindusara, Devourer of Enemies, has been murdered. Shortly after this dreadful news was made known, many of his sons engaged in a bloody battle over the throne, during which his son Ashoka proved victorious. However, while we may still have a raja, trouble is brewing within our realm. The recent deaths of Chandragupta and Bindusara have left their marks on our kingdom, and difficult times will lie ahead."
flavor_maurya_5.a:0 "Ashoka will fix this chaos."
flavor_maurya_5_tooltip:0 "#G Gain access to the Collapse Prevention mission tree#!. \n#R This mission tree will be failed if it is not completed before the death of Ashoka#!."

flavor_maurya_6_title:"Ashoka is Dead!"
