 messapia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "In 303BCE, a short war broke out involving the #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetName]s#!, #E  Tarentum#!, #E Sparta#!, and the #E Lucani#!. We will have to wait until we have finished addressing the war before we can move  on to other plans."
 
 messapia_missions_task_2:0 "Pyrrhic Plans"
 messapia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "The young but ambitious [GetCharacter('(int32)70').GetPraenomen] of #E Epirus#! has plans to  invade Italy and strike against #E Rome#!. We could join their war against the #E [GetCulture('roman').GetName]s#!, or we can  simply wait and take advantage of the situation by our own accords."
 
 messapia_missions_task_3:0 "Acquisition of Apulia"
 messapia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "The Daunian tribe form the northmost of the #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetName]#! people... however they have been occupied by the #E [GetCulture('roman').GetName]s#! and other #E [GetCultureGroup('latin').GetName]s#!. We must free them and remind them what it means to be amongst their blood brothers."
 
 messapia_missions_task_4:0 "Invasion of Italia"
 messapia_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The riches of the #E [GetCulture('roman').GetName]s#!, the #E [GetCulture('etruscan').GetName]s#!, and the other #E [GetCulture('roman').GetCultureGroup.GetName]s#! will be ours! This land is our homeland, and it's about time we made that abundantly clear to those who inhabit #E Italia#! with us."
 
 messapia_missions_task_5:0 "Across the Adriatic"
 messapia_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Our ancestral homelands of #E Illyria#! lay tauntingly close by. Conquering it does not mean a return to the old, but an introduction to the new while reclaiming our ancient roots. Let us shine our influence onto the land of #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]s#!."
 
 messapia_missions_task_6:0 "Mission to Magna Graecia"
 messapia_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "#E Magna Graecia#! and her people have perhaps had the most mercurial relations with our people compared to anyone else in our entire history. We've fought wars against them, yet at the same time, we've fought wars for them. Regardless, conquering the whole of it for ourselves will ensure that this region remains forever cemented as an ally, not a foe."
 
 messapia_missions_task_7:0 "Laws and Litigations"
 messapia_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "As we centralize into a proper state, we have many considerations on how to do so. While the #E [GetCulture('roman').GetName]s#! exemplify one model, the #E [GetCulture('italiotian').GetName]s#! show us another, and yet still the #E [GetCulture('syracusan').GetName]s#! have shown us multiple examples of governance. Let us decide exactly which structure to reference."
 
 messapia_missions_task_8:0 "Greek Governance"
 messapia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "The ways of Greek governance vary in many ways. The #E [GetCulture('macedonian').GetName]s#! for example have #Y Aristocratic Monarchy#! systems. While the #E [GetCulture('athenian').GetName]s#! have a #Y Democratic Republic#!. The #E [GetCulture('peloponnesian').GetName]s#! and their #Y Spartan Diarchy#! of course. So too are different the #E [GetCulture('italiotian').GetName]#! #Y City-States#! versus the many systems used by #E [GetCulture('syracusan').GetName]s#!. In short, we have many different ways to implement #E Hellenic#! ideas of governance to our state."
 
 messapia_missions_task_9:0 "Italic Inquiries"
 messapia_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "The Italian ways of governance constitute the #E [GetCulture('roman').GetName]s#! and their #Y Republic#!, but also the #E [GetCulture('etruscan').GetName]s#! and their decentralized way of a #Y Monarchy#!. Regardless, we have decided to inquire about the ways of the original natives of #E Italia#! to decide which fits our state the best."
 
 messapia_missions_task_10:0 "Enlightened Illyrians"
 messapia_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "To evolve forward, we must often look back. Of course, we retain many ideas of governing ourselves as our fellow #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]#! brothers, yet we can still find out more through them. Whether through contact they have had with peoples more civilized, or directly, we have much to learn from the #Y Governments#! of our cousins."
 
 messapia_missions_task_11:0 "Embrace the Wolf Cult"
 messapia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The Daunian tribe of [GetCulture('messapian').GetName|E] introduce us to their adoption of the #Y Wolf Cult#! while the eastern #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]s#! tell us of their #Y Sun Cult#!, #Y Snake Cult#!, and #Y Horseman Cult#!. All these cults may be the perfect fit for our diverse religious position if we choose to adopt more [GetReligion('illyrian_pantheon').GetName|E] religious influences."
 
 messapia_missions_task_12:0 "Embellish the Zis Cult"
 messapia_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "Our faith most resembles that of the [GetReligion('roman_pantheon').GetName|E] religion and it shall stay that way. With more [GetReligion('roman_pantheon').GetName|E] influence, we can #Y embelish#! the Cult of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_zis').GetName|E] and reap the benefits of staying consistent and strong in our beliefs."
 
 messapia_missions_task_13:0 "Empower the Menzanas Cult"
 messapia_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The [GetReligion('italic_pantheon').GetName|E] religion has long influenced deities that are unique to us. Truly, #Y embracing#! the [GetReligion('italic_pantheon').GetName|E] influences more directly will lead to our own native deities to be further #Y empowered#! and let us better be rewarded by our patron gods."
 
 messapia_missions_task_14:0 "Faith in Messapia"
 messapia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "Regardless of which faith we derive more influence from, we have found ourselves in a situation that undoubtedly embraces all three faiths into our own brand of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName|E] religion. And as our [GetCulture('messapian').GetName|E] faith spreads, it continues to grow and prosper with new influences, adapting to local beliefs while being upheld and centralized in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|E]."
 
 messapia_missions_task_15:0 "Deus or Theos?"
 messapia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "While we once came from the #E [GetReligion('illyrian_pantheon').GetName]#! coast, we have embraced #E [GetReligion('roman_pantheon').GetName]#! religion while at the same time being influenced heavily by the #E [GetReligion('italic_pantheon').GetName]#! religion. Thus, our beliefs have elements of each of these religions. As we expand our influence and integrate even more beliefs from these religions, the question of which peoples' faith we should accept the most influence from remains open."
 
 messapia_missions_task_16:0 "Crossroads of the Adriatic"
 messapia_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "The positioning of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is wonderful for absorbing cultural, political, and religious influences from #E Italy#!, #E Greece#!, and #E Illyria#!. This both offers us a thriving capital as well as the birthplace of decisions for which cultural influences we will endorse and which we will repress."
 
 messapia_missions_task_17:0 "The Messapian Realm"
 messapia_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Our realm is ready to pick our #Y Government#!. We have studied all our fellow peoples around us to decide, and it is that reason why we are confident in our choice."
 
 messapia_missions_task_18:0 "The Old Homeland"
 messapia_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)8026')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] was our original homeland. While we have diverged much from them, we certainly retain our status as #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]s#!. Thus, it's time we integrate our cousins to our control, showing them what we have learned from #E Greeks#! and #E Romans#!, while reminding them and ourselves of our ancestoral fatherland."
 
 messapia_missions_task_19:0 "Into Greece"
 messapia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "It seems no matter which direction one looks, there are [GetCulture('macedonian').GetCultureGroup.GetName|E] peoples. It was only a matter of time before we set our sights on [GetProvince('(int32)432')GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] itself."
 
 messapia_missions_task_20:0 "Magna Illyria"
 messapia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "An idea has been formed, one of 'Magna Illyria.' Much like the Greeks have their 'Magna Graecia,' our Magna Illyria is built by former [GetCulture('messapian').GetCultureGroup.GetName|E] colonies, provides much more land and population than our homeland, and all in all surpasses that of our origins. We have forged a new homeland, a new culture, a new religion, a new administration, and a new people. Long live Magna Illyria!"
 
 messapia_missions_task_21:0 "Our Future Decided"
 messapia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "We have chosen how to grow our #Y Culture#! through #Y Governance#! and through #Y Religion#!. We have truly become a proper, civilized, [GetCulture('messapian').GetName|E] state that the world has never seen before. Our future is secured, and our legacy has only just started to be built."
 
 messapia_missions_task_22:0 "Triumph Over Tarentum"
 messapia_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "#E Tarentum#! has been a thorn in our side for hundreds of years! The Spartiate colony and our mixed relations with them has been the largest rivalry in the entirety of our people's history. It is finally over. [GetProvince('(int32)56').GetName|E] is now a [GetCulture('messapian').GetName|E] city!"
 
 messapia_missions_task_23:0 "Brothers by Blood"
 messapia_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "The Peucetian people to our north form the tribe of #E Apulia#!. The 'true' Messapian people of the south form the tribe of #E Messapia#!. Both of us, however, are Iapygian, or #E [GetCulture('messapian').GetName]#!, people. For our own interests as well as theirs, we can come together diplomatically and unite against those who would see our people, culture, and beliefs erased from Italia."
 
 messapia_missions_task_24:0 "Ruin Rome"
 messapia_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)1').GetName|E], the great civilization and city of [GetProvince('(int32)56').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], shall finally meet its end from our own hands. While [GetProvince('(int32)1').GetName|E] once stood as the greatest city of #E Italia#!, it will be replaced by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|E]."

 messapia_missions_task_25:0 "Seize Sicily"
 messapia_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)84').GetArea.GetName|E] is a marvelously rich land. The greatest of Greek colonies, [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetName|E] should become our own possession. With the grains and riches of [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetArea.GetName|E], we will fuel our people and influence for generations to come."

 messapia_missions_task_26:0 "Conquest of Inner Italy"
 messapia_missions_task_26_DESC:0 "In many ways, Italy is our new homeland. So then, let us conquer the rest of it! The ways of the [GetCulture('roman').GetCultureGroup.GetName|E] have impacted our culture in so many ways, from the littlest bits of folklore to the largest ways of agriculture and farming. Finally, the entire region comes under our influence."

 messapia_missions_task_27:0 "Marulum Nostrum" #idk if correctly formed diminutive. own all the ardiatic coast
 messapia_missions_task_27_DESC:0 "The concept of Mare Nostrum, or our sea, is built upon having the entirety of the coast of a sea to ourselves. As the crossroads between cultures and religions of the Adriatic, it is only right that we come to have our own Mare Nostrum. However, the Adriatic is considerably smaller than the Mediterranian as a home, so perhaps 'Marulum,' or 'Small,' Nostrum is more fitting."

 messapia_missions_task_28:0 "Lessons from War"
 messapia_missions_task_28_DESC:0 "For once, we fought with the #E Greeks#! instead of against them. From this, we have learned more about their ways of warfare. Let us invest in implementing their ways in order to further our own capabilities."
