 # Mission

 miletos_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Miletos, well known for being the greatest of mother cities, founding over 90 colonies across the Hellenic world, was also home to many a great philosopher and scientist. \nHaving freed itself from a short Macedonian rule, hearts and minds across the city hope the polis' time for greatness has come. We will decide if, and how, we will adress all cities who have the honour of calling us their mother."

Debates in the Boule, once repressed, by and large are now free and brimming with intellectuals and ideas. These tend to end in endless rhetoric between citizens, diverging on if we must now seize control of our colonies to re-establish our place in the world."
 miletos_event.1.a:0 "They are Milesians all but in name, so we must rule them directly!"

 miletos_event.2.desc:0 "Few know of the subtleties of these coasts as well as those who've always been here; Ionians, Carians, Persians, Dorians, Anatolians, have been spilling blood here for centuries.\n\nNow, they're ours. Sacrifices have been made to Apollo Didymaion, our patron god, for our many victories, and processions and celebrations are being held across the city. But, on the eyes of every soldier, citizen and politician rests a glimmer, confident that this is not our apogee; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and its people, wish to soar much higher."
 miletos_event.2.a:0 "We shall celebrate in Didyma!"

 miletos_event.3.t:0 "$miletos_task_13$"

We now have conquered our home region, which is also home to other peoples who are decidedly not Greek, and who the Boule does not fully agree on how to deal with.\n\nSome sectors of society, almost a little too enthusiastic about [GetProvince('(int32)427').GetName]'s policies, argue they are barbarians occupying our land and ought to become true civilized Greeks (or else!), while others say that it doesn't matter they don't respect our overlordship and our customs, they're still to be respected by our people.\n\nStrangely, everyone seems to forget they were here before us."

Many sit in the symposions of high [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society gossip as to how can one man afford to build a fleet this large and expensive this quickly. All he asks in exchange for is the honour of leading said fleet across the seas, to enact revenge on those who have wronged [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It is up to us to decide if we will grant him this wish."
 miletos_event.5.a:0 "Clearly a superior man, but it will require some thinking."

 miletos_event.6.desc:0 "On these nigh-mythical lands, a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] expedition arrived after our conquest of [GetProvince('(int32)1743').GetName], with the intent of establishing our administration in the region. Here, they finally saw the extent of the achievement and of the fearlessness of our colonists. \n\nHere, in this dark, forested land, Greeks, such as ourselves, inhabit on the footsteps of peaks that scratch the heavens, one of them hiding away the titan Prometheus. They lived surounded by barbarian peoples, at times intelligible and at others hostile, and yet they thrived. Even more shockingly, our legates were received with a lavish feast, thanks to the influence of ourdiaspora in the city!"

A new kind of custom there has emerged, where two people endlessly have at one another (verbally) right in front of the docks, and even city-wide ''Milesian bickering'' championships have emerged."

And he hadn't even made it to [GetProvince('(int32)4513').GetName] yet. \n\nIt seems that our colonies along this Euxenian shore had the impression of being forgotten by their motherland."

Regardless of superstitions, a copy of that same map today is displayed on a wall of the newly-built West Agora, near the harbour, proudly displaying to all how far we've come."
