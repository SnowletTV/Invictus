 # Mission
 miletos_mission:0 "The Dreams of the Milesians"
 miletos_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Miletos, well known for being the greatest of mother cities, founding over 90 colonies across the Hellenic world, was also home to many a great philosopher and scientist. \nHaving freed itself from a short Macedonian rule, hearts and minds across the city hope the polis' time for greatness has come. We will decide if, and how, we will adress all cities who have the honour of calling us their mother."
 miletos_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have come into contact and exerted our influence over our old colonies."

 miletos_task_19:0 "Milesian Wool"
 miletos_task_19_DESC:0 "We are known far and wide for our trade of wool, but funnily enough we are only resellers, as the goats our shepherds herd don't produce it."
 miletos_task_20:0 "The Cult of Aphrodite"
 miletos_task_20_DESC:0 "Just after the twins Apollo and Artemis, Aphrodite is, along them, worshiped at Didyma. Let us give her worship a greater meaning in these coasts, at the house of her statue in [GetProvince('(int32)1987').GetName]."

 miletos_task_24:0 "Black Sea Trade"
 miletos_task_24_DESC:0 "The Pontos Euksenios, where our influence has always been so present and encompassing, has always paid us homage, but they surely owe us a little more than that..."

 miletos_task_27:0 "Hekataios' Legacy"

 miletos_task_28:0 "Hippodamos' Legacy"
 miletos_task_28_DESC:0 "Described by Aristotle as a strange, eccentric man thirsting for recognition, Hippodamos of Miletos was the first to study the ideal form of government, and, most importantly, was known as the father of city-planning and of the grid layout."

 miletos_task_32_DESC:0 "Democracy in [GetProvince('(int32)1973').GetName] was very similar to that of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName], as most decisions were prepared by a commission (or synhedrion), and then voted on by the people, resulting in a direct democracy."
 miletos_task_33:0 "Si Vis Pacem..."
 miletos_task_33_DESC:0 "Thousands of wars have thundered on Asia. It is not foolish to assume that that will happen again, but it would be very much so to not prepare for those coming days."

 miletos_event.1.desc:0 "'We who live between the Pillars of Herakles and Phasis inhabit some small part of it around the sea, just like ants or frogs around a pond.' \n\nSocrates said this of the Hellenes, and among those same Hellenes we have no equal, having founded over 90 colonies across the known world. Debates in the Boule, once repressed, by and large are now free and brimming with intellectuals and ideas. These tend to end in endless rhetoric between citizens, diverging on if we must now seize control of our colonies to re-establish our place in the world."
 miletos_event.1.a:0 "They are Milesians all but in name, so we must rule them directly!"

 miletos_event.2.desc:0 "Few know of the subtleties of these coasts as well as those who've always been here; Ionians, Carians, Persians, Dorians, Anatolians, have been spilling blood here for centuries.\n\nNow, they're ours. Sacrifices have been made to Apollo Didymaion, our patron god, for our many victories, and processions and celebrations are being held across the city. But, on the eyes of every soldier, citizen and politician rests a glimmer, confident that this is not our apogee; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and its people, wish to soar much higher."
 miletos_event.2.a:0 "We shall celebrate in Didyma!"

 miletos_event.3.t:0 "$miletos_task_13$"
 miletos_event.3.desc:0 "Conquering is one thing, ruling is another; let the Macedonian's empire bear witness. We now have conquered our home region, which is also home to other peoples who are decidedly not Greek, and who the Boule does not fully agree on how to deal with.\n\nSome sectors of society, almost a little too enthusiastic about [GetProvince('(int32)427').GetName]'s policies, argue they are barbarians occupying our land and ought to become true civilized Greeks (or else!), while others say that it doesn't matter they don't respect our overlordship and our customs, they're still to be respected by our people.\n\nStrangely, everyone seems to forget they were here before us."
 miletos_event.3.a:0 "We have no time for Anatolian superstitions. They are to become Greek."

It fills my heart that, when sailing from tough seas, every one of our sailors will find on these houses familiar faces, and I hope you share the sentiment.''"
 miletos_event.4.a:0 "[SCOPE.sChar('milesian_strategos').GetFirstName] may be slightly abusing his powers, but it is a good idea."

 miletos_event.5.desc:0 "Here too, in northern Pontos, we have resided since the time of the Ten Thousand. These strange lands on the way to [GetProvince('(int32)1720').GetName], as said by Strabo, only welcomed us in tiny settlements along the coast, but we've now arrived in full force, being sole masters of the area. \n\nEcstatic, [edmond_dantes.GetName], a mysterious sailor-turned-merchant in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has built, and donated, a titanic fleet to the poleis. Many sit in the symposions of high [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society gossip as to how can one man afford to build a fleet this large and expensive this quickly. All he asks in exchange for is the honour of leading said fleet across the seas, to enact revenge on those who have wronged [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It is up to us to decide if we will grant him this wish."
 miletos_event.5.a:0 "Clearly a superior man, but it will require some thinking."

 miletos_event.6.t:0 "$miletos_task_4$"
 miletos_event.6.desc:0 "On these nigh-mythical lands, a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] expedition arrived after our conquest of [GetProvince('(int32)1743').GetName], with the intent of establishing our administration in the region. Here, they finally saw the extent of the achievement and of the fearlessness of our colonists. \n\nHere, in this dark, forested land, Greeks, such as ourselves, inhabit on the footsteps of peaks that scratch the heavens, one of them hiding away the titan Prometheus. They lived surounded by barbarian peoples, at times intelligible and at others hostile, and yet they thrived. Even more shockingly, our legates were received with a lavish feast, thanks to the influence of ourdiaspora in the city!"
 miletos_event.6.a:0 "We are an indomitable people."

A new kind of custom there has emerged, where two people endlessly have at one another (verbally) right in front of the docks, and even city-wide ''Milesian bickering'' championships have emerged."
