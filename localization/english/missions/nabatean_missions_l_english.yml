Sandstone fortifications seemingly appear from nowhere, clustered around the life-giving waters that sustain our populace.\n\nYour eyes do not deceive you, Traveler; this is no mirage that you are witnessing, but the birthplace of a mighty nation."
nabatea_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete once we have conquered our neighbors, extending our hegemony far into the #E Syrian Desert#! to the north, and have built an illustrious civilization that rivals our peers for glory."
