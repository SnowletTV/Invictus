nabhapakti_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Long gone are the Republics of the Koliyas, Moriyas, Mallakas, and the Shakyas, however, we can reinstate ourselves and honor the legacy of the Shakya Republic."

nabhapakti_missions_task_4:0 "King of the Nepali"
nabhapakti_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Nepali people have been displaced into the mountains, and we remain the last tribe of the Nepali. In order to face the stronger powers within the region, we should centralize into a Kingdom, and establish a Kingdom for the Nepali."

nabhapakti_missions_task_5:0 "Question of Capital"
nabhapakti_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "The city of Selanpura is a fine capital, however, it may make sense to establish new capital in Malla, which holds the legacy and prestige of the Shakya."

nabhapakti_missions_task_6:0 "Birthplace of Buddha"
nabhapakti_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "It is well known that the birthplace of the great Buddha was, in fact, in the old state of Shakya. We are the carriers of that legacy, and so, it is our responsibility to spread the teachings of Buddha beyond our borders. Let us tell the world that it is we who will teach them of the teachings of Buddha."

nabhapakti_missions_task_7:0 "Fief of the Mountains"
nabhapakti_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "We should establish a #Y Buddhist Fiefdom#! on the roof of the world! Our closest neighbors, they will be a prime target for us to expand our influence #E more directly#!."

nabhapakti_missions_task_8:0 "Fief of the East"
nabhapakti_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "A #Y Buddhist Fiefdom#! at the easternmost edges of the known world, spreading #E Buddhist#! ideology far beyond what we could have ever imagined possible."

nabhapakti_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "The #T Bay of Bengal#! is one of the most proserous trade hubs in the world. There's no telling how deep we can strengthen the will of #E Sidhartha#! across all of #T Indian Ocean#! with a #Y Buddhist Fiefdom#! in #T Bengal#!."

nabhapakti_missions_task_10:0 "Beacon of Buddhism"
nabhapakti_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "We have done our best to convince potential peoples to embrace the teachings of Buddhism. Our efforts are not unnoticed and #E Buddhists#! across the #T Ganges to the Indus#! are impressed with our commitment and redoubled their own efforts!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_11:0 "The Matter of Malla"
nabhapakti_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "#E Malla#! and the #E Mallans#! were our brothers in the time of the Republics. Their land should belong to us and not the #T Mauryans#!."

nabhapakti_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The #T Ganges River Valley#! is arguably the greatest of all of #T India#!. Home to not only our own society, but countless of ideas, wealth, and people of all types.

nabhapakti_missions_task_13:0 "Buddha for the Bonpo"
nabhapakti_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "#Y Buddhist Envoys#! will be sent for #E one year#! to #T Tibet#!.\n\nSend a delegation of Buddhist ascetics and monks to the Tibetan region in hopes they accept the teachings of Buddha. Our neighbors in the mountains have Bon beliefs currently, however perhaps we can convince them that Buddha has a place within their belief system. Expanding our influence in our immediate neighborhood will help us push our influence beyond to countries further than our border.\n\n#G By learning to influence our neighbor, our success in the region #E could positively affect#! our missions to #E Bengal.#!#!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_14:0 "Buddha of Burma"
nabhapakti_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "#Y Buddhist Envoys#! will be sent for #E one year#! to #T Burma#!.\n\nSend a delegation of Buddhist ascetics and monks to the Burma region in hopes they accept the teachings of Buddha. Burma is a collection of mixed Tibetan and Pyu peoples, heavily influenced by Vedic and Shramanic religions as well as their native religions.\n\n#G Due to the Bonpo descended people in the region, our success in the region #E could positively affect#! our missions to the Bonpo in #E Tibet.#!#!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_15:0 "Buddha in Bengal"
nabhapakti_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "#Y Buddhist Envoys#! will be sent for #E one year#! to #T Bengal#!.\n\nSend a delegation of Buddhist ascetics and monks to the Bengal region in hopes that they accept the teachings of Buddha.

nabhapakti_missions_task_16:0 "Poison Pill"
nabhapakti_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "While we are but a subject to the #E Mauryans#! for now, they will soon find they have swallowed a #E Poison Pill#!. Let us turn the subjects of the #E Mauryans#! #R against them#! and join into our #Y Poison Pill League#!."

nabhapakti_missions_task_17:0 "Restore Kalinga"
nabhapakti_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Our brothers in #Y Kalinga#! were once a powerful, independent #E Buddhist#! kingdom, and they have been somehow destroyed! Let us restore our brothers to their rightful place, of course, under our hegemony!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_18:0 "Informal Empire"
nabhapakti_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "While unorthodox, few would argue our hegemony over our domain and our subjects domain. We are an empire in all but name, so let us incorporate a better fitting #E Imperial Cult#! government style, and strengthen our control over our vassals even further."

nabhapakti_missions_task_19:0 "Belly of the Beast"
nabhapakti_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "We have found ourselves in the #E Belly of the Beast#! that is #T Chandragupta Maurya's#! empire. We will work hard to succeed in our new position as a subject state."

nabhapakti_missions_task_22:0 "Influence the Indus"
nabhapakti_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "The Indus Valley is home to inconcievable wealth, knowledge, and resources.

nabhapakti_missions_task_23:0 "Call to the Jungle"
nabhapakti_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "The Jungles of central India, between the great Deccan Plateau and the lands between the Indus and Ganges, the untamed land sits.

nabhapakti_missions_task_24:0 "Buddha for the Greeks"
nabhapakti_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "In the lands past the Hindu-Kush lay the remnants of #T Alexander the Great's#! empire.

nabhapakti_missions_task_25:0 "Sword of Siddhartha"
nabhapakti_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "Although #E Buddhism#! preaches peace, the time has come for us to raise the holy #G Sword of Sidhartha#! and #R strike against#! the #T Mauryan Empire#!, along with any countries that have joined our #Y Poison Pill League#!."

nabhapakti_missions_task_r1:0 "Cities of Nepal"
nabhapakti_missions_task_r1_DESC:0 "In order to have a functioning republic, we should empower and urbanize the people. Even though undertaking a massive building initiative will require vast sums of money and a great many workers, it shall be well worth the effort."

nabhapakti_missions_task_r2_DESC:0 "We sit in a precarious position, surrounded by powerful enemies that could whimsically decide one morning to invade our homelands; let us harbor no illusions about our neighbors.

nabhapakti_missions_task_r3:0 "Feed our Cities"
nabhapakti_missions_task_r3_DESC:0 "A full stomach is one of the first steps towards true happiness and contentment, and an unprepared society is only a famine away from total collapse. We will feed our cities and they will thrive!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_r4:0 "The Second Vajjika League"
nabhapakti_missions_task_r4_DESC:0 "Although the original Vajjika league saw both we and the many Mallan brothers excluded, it was due to the oppressive Kosala Kingdom. We sat to the side as a buffer state between the Kingdom and the great city-states and republics. Now, we can re-establish the league under our own leadership, taking our rightful place within it at and at the helm."

nabhapakti_missions_task_r5:0 "Kingdom of Kosala"
nabhapakti_missions_task_r5_DESC:0 "The Vajjika League was once under the vassalhood of the Kingdom of Kosala. Now, though, the gods are with us, and we shall make them our vassal instead - this has been ordained by the will of Heaven."

nabhapakti_missions_task_k2_DESC:0 "The same mountain passes that we use to launch raids into the lands of our foes could also be used against our own people; this is the reality of the danger that faces us.

nabhapakti_missions_task_k3:0 "Feed our Capital"
nabhapakti_missions_task_k3_DESC:0 "Our people demand food, and so food we must give - whether we import grains from abroad or grow it in our farms, we have a pressing need that must be dealt with."

nabhapakti_missions_task_k4_DESC:0 "The jewel in the Himilayas grows every more precious, with many casting their envious faces towards the greatest city in all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] with open admiration. Let us not stop now - we must ascend to even further heights!"

nabhapakti_missions_task_k5_DESC:0 "The Kirata Kingdom in Indian mythos was a nation created by the Kirata people of the #E Himalayas#!, and we hear the call of their legacy - we will refound this mythological Kingdom and rule over our people from the tips of the mountains!"
