 #Missions
 
 01_native_pontus_task_1:0 "Birthplace of Silver"
 01_native_pontus_task_1_DESC:0 "The eastern Pontic mountains are home to rich silver mines. Since the time of the Hittites and the Assyrians, the mines in this region have supplied wealthy kings and emperors, and a legend was created that these mountains were the birthplace of silver because of their seemingly endless wealth. Their 'endless' nature ought to be tested."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_2:0 "Organizing the Pontic Lands"
 01_native_pontus_task_2_DESC:0 "A disorganized puzzle of loose claims and realms, Pontus is quite precariously held together by a chiefdom. For the Pontic people to prosper, the authority must be centralized and and a ruler must be crowned."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_3:0 "Iron in the East"
 01_native_pontus_task_3_DESC:0 "In Pontus, in the eastern reaches of Asia Minor, the iron mines have served as weapons production sources since ancient times. In order to fuel any new conquests and a standing army which can stabilize the borders, more iron production is needed."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_4:0 "The Amisos Opportunity"
 01_native_pontus_task_4_DESC:0 "Amisos monopolizes a majority of the outgoing trade in Pontus. This obstacle to the dominance of the hinterlands should be dealt with quickly and pragmatically. Forming closer ties with or outright conquering the port should grant greater trade access for the precious metals in the Pontic east."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_5:0 "The Amaseian Throne"
 01_native_pontus_task_5_DESC:0 "Building a strong, central capital in Amaseia would allow the throne of Pontus to make the most prudent decisions regarding political and domestic policy. The city should be rebuilt to match its old majesty, with a great hall that amazes foreign visitors."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_6:0 "Legitimacy in Ameria"
 01_native_pontus_task_6_DESC:0 "In the history of Pontus, Ameria has served as the home of the ruler cult since the earliest of times. In order to cement the authority held by the king of Pontus, the worship of the throne must be revived in that sacred city."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_7:0 "Pontic Temple States"
 01_native_pontus_task_7_DESC:0 "The realm of Pontus has long been home to temple states, or small cults run out of grand temples which also administered fields and small towns within their surrounding area. Supporting these temple states can revive immigration to the Pontic inland as well as grant the throne divine favor."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_8:0 "The Legacy of Themiskyra"
 01_native_pontus_task_8_DESC:0 "The Greeks believe that the warrior-women of legend, the Amazons, lived in this place. It is true that the coastal town is surrounded by much mystery, but the Pontic government can certainly capitalize on this wild belief - who wouldn't want to come see a fantastical, female-led society."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_9:0 "East Pontic Warriors"
 01_native_pontus_task_9_DESC:0 "While all Pontic soldiers are fierce and feared across the lands, the more barbarous Pontic inhabitants, living in the eastern mountainous zones, have proven to be unbelievably wild in combat, never fearing death and facing any size of army head on. It is in the Pontic interest to recruit these berserk warriors into the grand Pontic armies."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_10:0 "The Realgar Mines"
 01_native_pontus_task_10_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_11:0 "Sinopean Ochre"
 01_native_pontus_task_11_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_12:0 "The Pontic Coast"
 01_native_pontus_task_12_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_13:0 "The Citadel of Amaseia"
 01_native_pontus_task_13_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_14:0 "The Caenon Fortress"
 01_native_pontus_task_14_DESC:0 "The naturally fortified hill at Caenon, near Amaseia, has long served as an escape-ready stonghold, a 'Plan B' in case the worse happened to the Pontic capital. Yet, beyond this function, the citadel there also serves as a quite useful holding reserve for the treasury of Pontus. Were it to be renovated, the Caenon Fortress could serve as the royal reserve."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_15:0 "Faith of Ameria"
 01_native_pontus_task_15_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_16:0 "Faith of Komana Pontica"

 01_native_pontus_task_19_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_20:0 "The Amomum Trade"
 01_native_pontus_task_20_DESC:0 "A rare breed of spices, Amomum comes to the Pontic lands from far away southern markets, such as those in Gordyene. Those spices travel the Royal Persian Road, which winds through Pontus and Cappadocia on its way to western Anatolia. These spices could enhance local markets if the long-winded merchants could only be persuaded to stay in our towns and cities."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_21:0 "The Tuna Trade"
 01_native_pontus_task_21_DESC:0 "Schools of Tuna run a circuit around the Pontus Euxinos, growing up in the waters around the Tauric peninsula before migrating along the Colchian and Pontic coast before they reach a headland around Sinope - it is around here where they have become ripest, growing to their largest sizes but retaining the musclar vigor of youth. The Pontic fishermand should be given more access to these fish for selling at local ports."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_22:0 "The Shepherds of Gadlion"
 01_native_pontus_task_22_DESC:0 "TODO."

 01_native_pontus_task_30_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_31:0 "The Bosporus Straight"
 01_native_pontus_task_31_DESC:0 "The trade of the Bosporus splitting Asia and Europa dwarfs all that which traverses the Anatolian roads. If Pontus is to truly come into its own as a hegemon of Anatolian economics, it must control the lands bordering the straight so that Pontic coffers can profit off of the tax offices along the coast of the windy, dangerous straight where all ships take their leave seasonally."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_32:0 "The Colchian Lands"
 01_native_pontus_task_32_DESC:0 "Known as the land of gold, both in ancient times and even now, Aeetes' Kolchis would serve as a grand holding to take over and use for greater naval military and maritime trade access - we should conquer it swiftly."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_33:0 "Cappadocia et Paphlagonia"
 01_native_pontus_task_33_DESC:0 "Pontus has previously been known as Cappadocia by the sea. There are many within the Pontic hinterland who speak the Cappadocian tongue and have generational memories of the Cappadocian and Paphlagonian union under the Achaemenids. There is a political structure to take advantage of here, and to step into the role of, should Pontus be able to conquer both of these lands."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_34:0 "The Schools of Amaseia"
 01_native_pontus_task_34_DESC:0 "TODO."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_35:0 "Ameria Ruler Cult"
 01_native_pontus_task_35_DESC:0 "Confirm and formalize the ruler cult present in Ameria so that the throne always has a loyal base of support, not only for the current king, but for his line of succession."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_36:0 "A Hittite Identity"
 01_native_pontus_task_36_DESC:0 "The ancient tablets held within the storage rooms of the Komana Pontika temple state (as well as others) have messages inscribed in them with a text a rare few have any knowledge of. Some scholars have wondered how far the roots of the state's current inhabitants reach, going back to the original writers of these tablets. This research should be supported if it serves to enhance a regional identity and loyalty."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_37:0 "The Western Pontus Euxinos"
 01_native_pontus_task_37_DESC:0 "The Greek city states in the Western Black Sea have spent centuries developing their trade-market access in the sea. Through diplomatic or military means, controlling their ports and using their expertise to increase the variety of available goods at home would increase the attraction of Pontus."
 
 01_native_pontus_task_38:0 "The Eastern Pontus Euxinos"
 01_native_pontus_task_38_DESC:0 "TODO."

 01_native_pontus_task_40:0 "The Cimmerian Bosporus"
 01_native_pontus_task_40_DESC:0 "The Tauric peninsula and the Cimmerian Bosporus, named for those famed and feared horselords who ravaged the Near East centuries ago, remain a great source for grain and slaves to work in the mines or in the fields. Should political affairs at home grow to dangerous, this place would also prove a safe retreat from the problems of Asia Minor."
