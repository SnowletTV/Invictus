 nuragic_mission_01_inv: "Reclaiming The Nuragic Homeland"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION: "For as long as the sun has traversed its path in the celestial realms, our people have lived simple and uneventful lives, our fortunes ebbing and flowing like the ocean waters that surround us. While some sneer at our ways and call us barbarians, we were content with what we had to call our own.\n\nThis has changed with the arrival of the #E Carthaginians#!, who have seized the southern coast of our island for themselves. Their diplomats have made it abundantly clear that our mountainous homelands are not safe from their encroaching armies, but we have a different idea about our future."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when we have pushed the foreigners from our island and reclaimed it for ourselves."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We must expel the invaders from our homeland!"

 # Mission Tasks
 ####################


 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task: "Gathering The Tribal Elders"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task_DESC: "Before we make any moves against the foreigners, we must first gather a consensus amongst our tribal brethren. We cannot do this alone; we will need to unite our strength if we have any hope of succeeding. Send word to the neighboring tribes that a Council will be held! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task: "Securing The Reserves"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task_DESC: "If we have any hopes of winning in the field, our soldiers must be well-fed and ready to fight at any time, for hunger is an ever-present enemy that is difficult to escape. As soon as we have the funds available to us, we should build a farming settlement, as well as import as much grain as we can store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task: "Restore The Nuraghes"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task_DESC: "In ages past, our people erected #T Nuraghe#!, conical stone towers, thousands of them. They've been built all across the islands, out of basalt, granite and limestone, to fullfill a number of purposes within our society and to please our Father. Before we wage our own wars, we must honor the ancient ways and make sure that the important nuraghes for our communities shall be restored to their ancient glory - as well as properly stocked with provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task: "The First City To Fall"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task_DESC: "There is a city in the north that the Carthaginians have named [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] that is relatively isolated...this shall be the first to fall to our armies. Having no cities of our own, we hope to use [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] as a base of operations moving forward, so it is of vital importance that we eventually develop the infrastructure there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task: "Locking The Back Door"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task_DESC: "The Taphros strait is what separates Corsica from us, taking control of [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] would guarantee a safe access to those waters and secure a strength point against whoever tries to cross it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task: "A Foothold In Phikaria"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task_DESC: "Dreams of foreign conquest are the last thing that we wish to entangle ourselves with, but all can see the prudence of securing the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3508').GetName] for our own purposes. Besides, we have no desire to see the Corsians prosper, especially at our expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task: "Eyes On The Hills"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task_DESC: "One clear advantage that we have over the foreigners is that we know these lands well, whereas they are mere trespassers. We can use our knowledge of the terrain to our advantage, sending our men through difficult country to keep an eye on their troop movements.\n\nThe brigands that live in the mountains are expert trackers; we should send word of an amnesty, if they are willing to help us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task: "The Sacred Oath"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task_DESC: "For too long we stood in our mountains, watching the foreigners consuming our rich mineral veins, desecrating our holy sites, and cutting and burning our ancient forests at the expenses of our beautiful land. Every Sardinian shall know, from the Nurrenses in the north to the Galillenses in the south, no matter if Balarian or Iliensian, that we shall have our vengeance. We will honour our gods and our forefathers with pools of our enemies blood!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task: "The Port Of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task_DESC: "The Carthaginians consider the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] to be vital to their resupplying efforts, and because of this, we cannot allow them to control this location any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task: "Marching Towards [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task_DESC: "Like animals in a blood frenzy, our soldiers, bolstered by their recent successes in the field, can sense the doom of the invaders and demand that we press onward to [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName], undoubtedly desirous of the rich treasures that are purported to be held within its walls. The time has come to let our victorious soldiers enjoy some plundering! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task: "Karalian Farmlands"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task_DESC: "Truly, we have seen few places like [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]; a city surrounded by fertile vineyards, kissed by the sun and where true happiness surely lives. All who pass by this city desire an end to their travels, longing to stay on our estates and watch the dolphins play in waters of the Mare Tyrrhenum. We shall cultivate Karali, building it into a magnificent city regardless of the cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task: "A Southern Capital"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task_DESC: "Having become the undisputed masters of our island, with our authority being acknowledged from the northern redoubts to the southernmost cities - indeed, the entirety of Sardinia is ours - it is safe to say that a new era has dawned, one where the Sardana people will have a homeland of their own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task: "Seize The Ships"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task_DESC: "Now that we have managed to secure a port city for ourselves, we should consider constructing a fleet immediately. Luckily for us, in their haste to vacate the region, the enemy abandoned a few ships that are in decent condition; it wouldn't take much to get them back in working order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task: "A Blind Eye To Piracy"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task_DESC:0 "Many of the Sardinian pirates which roam on the eastern coast of our land have taken the opportunity to settle on the small islands in front of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]...perhaps they would like to come visit us for a while? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task: "The Old Cousins"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task_DESC: "In the ages past, when our people were at the peak of their power in sea and land, the seafiring Balarian tribes of northern Sardinia took controls of the islands in the west, to which it is said they gave their own name. There we built hundreds of Nuraghes alike to our own, there we brought our ways of life and knowledge, until the Carthaginians showed up and seized control of the archipelago.\n\nOf the three islands, the one currently known as Mago was considered our preferred seat of power in the area, under the name of Nura. As we have freed our island from the hands of the descendants of Tyre, we shall also free our cousins in the west. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 me_nuragic_1_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] bursts out of the tent, a filthy stream of curses erupting from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mouth, and moments later is joined by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] entire entourage. All that are standing outside - not an insignificant number, as a large number of soldiers have been milling about all morning - can thus see for themselves how the negotiations are going.

I expected our cousins to answer the sacred call, considering that we have many Sardana tribes on this island, but I shouldn't be surprised that they all slink away from a war council.' Turning towards a red-faced [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetName], who is standing with arms crossed, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] extends [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] finger and continues [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tirade, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice trembling in anger.\n\n'I believe that you are all cowards, unworthy to sleep with pigs! [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetFirstName], you dare to come here with honeyed words promising a false peace, your breath sweetened by Carthaginian wine and your pockets flush with their silver - enough! You are no partner in war, but a serpent in the grass. Leave at once, lest I break my oath of hospitality and strike you down where you stand!' The mood in the throng turns ugly as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] screams 'There shall be no mercy shown to anyone! Sardinia will be ours!'"

[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] walked through the fields, inspecting the quality of the soil, and spent hours walking through the storerooms, checking the provender for the farm animals and whether or not their stalls were properly cleaned - no detail was deemed too insignificant for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention. After an incredibly long day, everyone was relieved when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] made his pronouncement."

The work is grueling, and the laborers often complain mightily during the heat of the day, but all are aware that this difficult work is of utmost importance.\n\nAlthough we have full faith in the ability of our soldiers to protect our people, our minds are at ease, knowing that, if all else fails, we can gather within the walls of the nuraghe to regain our strength."

For months, the Carthaginians have known of our preparations, but in their hubris, dismissed us as mere barbarians, incapable of executing our war plans. They thought themselves safe behind their walls, but they clearly misunderstood the nature of the danger they were in.\n\nTurning to a nearby advisor, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] drily gives an order. 'Find the commander of the citadel and send his head to Carthage. Spare no one else that you find.'"

Still, the soldiers at the worksite are more than capable of driving off these skirmishers, so work draws to its inevitable conclusion.\n\nAlthough the fortress at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is an impressive achievement, our chief architect has informed us that we could do more to bolster our defenses, if we have the coin to do so."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.5.a:0 "This is more than suitable for our purposes"

With a bit of luck, we will be able to keep this advantage, especially with the aid of those who dwell in the mountains, who know these roads like the back of their own hands."

Bands of warriors have been summoned inside #E Nurac Nurdole#! to bind their destiny to the will of Sardo. One by one, each initiate was conducted inside the Nuraghe - there, the holy swords in the stones and the sacred water of the holy well instilled religious fear in the soul. At the center of the sacred enclosure, macaws and sacrificed animals awaited them, with horned-helmet warriors lined up with drawn swords.\n\nThe youth was led before the altars more as a victim than as an initiate, with each attendant swearing that they would not reveal what was seen or heard. They forced the initiates to swear by a specially-made formula; let there be a curse upon them, upon their family and kin, if they refused to fight where their generals wished, or if they ran away from the battlefield, or watched another flee and did nothing to kill him. Some who had refused to speak the sacred words in that way were barbarously killed before the altars. Their corpses, abandoned among the other victims, were an example to others who refused to swear."

For a long time, we've let the #E Phoenicians#! create trade posts on several of our coastal settlements, bringing great profit to our people while our settlements became rich and competitive cities.  All of this changed with the arrival of the #E Carthaginians#! - another Phoenician colony located in Africa, which, after subjugating their local rivals, decided to seize control of our beloved island.\n\nSo began the war - the Carthaginian expedition was led by Malco, a general already victorious against the Greeks in Sicily. Many field battles were fought on our Iolean Plain, til Malco and his force were completly annihilated and forced to abandon our lands. Malco himself, returning at Carthage after the catastrophic defeat, was executed by his own people.\n\nGreat were the feasts we had to celebrate our victory, yet the peace didn't last long. Five years after the failed attempt of Malco, his sons Hamilcar and Hasdrubal returned again, stronger than before, to conquer our land. Our plains were yet ravaged by another devastating conflict. Many were the attempts to repel the invaders, often successful and often a failure. After thirty long years of war, a stalemate was reached; the Carthaginians could not expand further in our interior hills and mountains, therefore ensuring our control of the northern and eastern coasts, yet we had lost forever our great Iolean Plains and the rich mineral fields of the south.\n\nFor two hundred years, Carthage has attempted to further expand in our lands, yet thanks to the harsh conditions of the terrain and the indomitable strength of our ancestors, we've managed to maintain our freedom. We often conduct ambushes and skirmishes on the plains once owned by our forefathers, for if we cannot take them back, none shall benefit from the fruits.\n\nStill today, the foreigners have been reluctant to settle on our island, discouraged - both by us and both by the poisonous air which has enveloped the lost plains of our forefathers since the day we left them. However, for too long we have permitted these filthy interlopers to grow wealthy at our expenses, consuming our rich mineral veins and impoverishing our farmlands for their own profit. The time to retake the Iolean Plain has come; our enemies shall again witness the fury of those who built the Towers.

It is said that our forefathers built hundreds of Nuraghes in the island of Mago, previously known as Nura - [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] cannot stand the fact that these other Nuraghes are held by foreigners. 'Something must be done, but what? Perhaps the best course of action is one that nobody would ever suspect..."
