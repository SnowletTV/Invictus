 nuragic_mission_01_inv:0 "Reclaiming The Nuragic Homeland"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "For as long as the sun has traversed its path in the celestial realms, our people have lived simple and uneventful lives, our fortunes ebbing and flowing like the ocean waters that surround us. While some sneer at our ways and call us barbarians, we were content with what we had to call our own.\n\nThis has changed with the arrival of the #E Carthaginians#!, who have seized the southern coast of our island for themselves. Their diplomats have made it abundantly clear that our mountainous homelands are not safe from their encroaching armies, but we have a different idea about our future."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have pushed the foreigners from our island and reclaimed it for ourselves."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must expel the invaders from our homeland!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task:0 "Gathering The Tribal Elders"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task_DESC:0 "Before we make any moves against the foreigners, we must first gather a consensus amongst our tribal brethren. We cannot do this alone; we will need to unite our strength if we have any hope of succeeding. Send word to the neighboring tribes that a Council will be held! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task:0 "Securing The Reserves"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task_DESC:0 "If we have any hopes of winning in the field, our soldiers must be well-fed and ready to fight at any time, for hunger is an ever-present enemy that is difficult to escape. As soon as we have the funds available to us, we should build a farming settlement, as well as import as much grain as we can store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task:0 "Restore The Nuraghes"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task_DESC:0 "In ages past, our people erected #T Nuraghes#!, conical stone towers, thousands of them. They've been built all across the islands, out of basalt, granite and limestone, to fullfill a number of purposes within our society and to please our Father. Before we wage our own wars, we must honor the ancient ways and make sure that the important Nuraghes for our communities will be restored to their ancient glory - as well as properly stocked with provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task:0 "The Foreshore of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] was once a Phocaean colony known by the name of Olbia, which faced its demise a mere 20 years after its foundation by a joint force of Etruscans and Punics.\n\nThe settlement of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] and its port currently comprise the main base of operations for the Carthaginian's seafiring actions along the eastern coasts of Sardinia. Its relatively isolated position shall eventually help our efforts of conquest.\n\nWe hope to use [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] for our own purposes, so it is of vital importance that we eventually develop the infrastructure there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task:0 "Locking The Back Door"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task_DESC:0 "The Taphros strait is what separates Corsica from us, and taking control of [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] would guarantee safe access to those waters and secure a strength point against whoever tries to cross it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task:0 "A Foothold In Phikaria"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task_DESC:0 "Perched on the rocky southern edge of Corsica, facing the straits of sea that separate it from our homeland, the settlement of [GetProvince('(int32)3508').GetName] stands as both a sentinel and a prize. It watches the southern winds, the ebb and flow of ships, the shadow of Sardinia across the waters. And yet—despite its position, despite its promise—it remains exposed.\n\nThis must change. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task:0 "Eyes On The Hills"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task_DESC:0 "One clear advantage that we have over the foreigners is that we know these lands well, whereas they are mere trespassers. We can use our knowledge of the terrain to our advantage, sending our men through difficult country to keep an eye on their troop movements.\n\nThe brigands that live in the mountains are expert trackers; we should send word of an amnesty, if they are willing to help us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task:0 "The Sacred Oath"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task_DESC:0 "For too long we stood in our mountains, watching the foreigners consuming our rich mineral veins, desecrating our holy sites, and cutting and burning our ancient forests at the expenses of our beautiful land.\n\nEvery Sardinian shall know, from the Nurrenses in the north to the Galillenses in the south, no matter if Balarian or Iliensian, that we shall have our vengeance. We will honor our gods and our forefathers with pools of our enemies' blood!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task:0 "The Port Of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task_DESC:0 "The Carthaginians consider the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] to be vital to their resupplying efforts, and because of this, we cannot allow them to control this location any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task:0 "Marching Towards [GetProvince('(int32)3483').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task_DESC:0 "Like animals in a blood frenzy, our soldiers, bolstered by their recent successes in the field, can sense the doom of the invaders and demand that we press onward to [GetProvince('(int32)3483').GetName], undoubtedly desirous of the rich treasures that are purported to be held within its walls. The time has come to let our victorious soldiers enjoy some plundering! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task:0 "Karalian Farmlands"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task_DESC:0 "Truly, we have seen few places like [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]; a city surrounded by fertile vineyards, kissed by the sun and where true happiness surely lives. All who pass by this city desire an end to their travels, longing to stay on our estates and watch the dolphins play in waters of the Mare Tyrrhenum. We shall cultivate Karali, building it into a magnificent city regardless of the cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task:0 "A New Capital"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task_DESC:0 "Having become the undisputed masters of our island, with our authority being acknowledged from the northern redoubts to the southernmost cities - indeed, the entirety of Sardinia is ours - it is safe to say that a new era has dawned, one where the Sardana people will have a homeland of their own.\n\n#Y In one week, we can choose to move our capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task:0 "Seize The Ships"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task_DESC:0 "Dozens of ships, idle and anchored, resting on calm waters like beasts unaware of the spear. They are not prepared. Their sailors walk the docks in comfort, their captains feast within the city. They do not yet believe we would dare move against them. And that will be their undoing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task:0 "A Blind Eye To Piracy"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task_DESC:0 "Many of the Sardinian pirates which roam on the eastern coast of our land have taken the opportunity to settle on the small islands in front of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]...perhaps they would like to come visit us for a while? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task:0 "The Old Cousins"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task_DESC:0 "In the ages past, when our people were at the peak of their power in sea and land, the seafaring Balarian tribes of northern Sardinia took controls of the islands in the west, to which it is said they gave their own name. There we built hundreds of Nuraghes alike to our own, there we brought our ways of life and knowledge, until the Carthaginians showed up and seized control of the archipelago.\n\nOf the three islands, the one currently known as Mago was considered our preferred seat of power in the area, under the name of Nura. As we have freed our island from the hands of the descendants of Tyre, we shall also free our cousins in the west. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_17_task:0 "The Mines Of Palma"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_17_task_DESC:0 "Now that we have conquered [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], we should dismantle the settlements of the #E Balearics#! and build a mine instead - those fools were literally sitting on top of a gold mine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_18_task:0 "Settle [GetProvince('(int32)3510').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_18_task_DESC:0 "If we are able to capture the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], then we will be able to use the wealth of that rich region to fund construction in [GetProvince('(int32)3510').GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic9!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_19_task:0 "Strait Of Taphros"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_19_task_DESC:0 "Developing the cities around Taphros will induce a newer trade influx among our strait, thus enabling our local marketplaces to prosper and thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_20_task:0 "The Grain Of Nurrensia"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_20_task_DESC:0 "The plains of Nurrensia, located in the north-western part of Sardinia, are notorious for the fertility of the soil and a mild climate. [GetProvince('(int32)3496').GetName] is suitable for cultivating a large network of the finest wheat varieties we are able to grasp - our people will excavate enough canals and wells to bring the water we need for the future granary of our civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_21_task:0 "Raze The Foreigns"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_21_task_DESC:0 "For generations, we watched from our high places. We endured. The mountain bred in us patience, and the knowledge that even iron breaks if bent long enough. Their mines poison the earth. Their outposts grow fat and arrogant. Their temples speak false tongues. And yet they believe us broken, scattered—content to haunt the forests and heights like ghosts. They have forgotten who we are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil16!"

 nuragic_mission_01_inv_22_task:0 "Build A Fleet"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_22_task_DESC:0 "The Sardan spirit yearns not only for stone underfoot, but for the taste of brine on the wind and the creak of a mast under sky. We were not born to be penned in mountains, watching from afar as foreigners feast on the wealth of our island and steer their ships through our waters as if we were gone from the world.\n\nNo more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_23_task:0 "Aim To Corsica"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_23_task_DESC:0 "The sea between Sardinia and Corsica has always been narrow—but never has it felt narrower than now. On clear days, we can see the peaks of our sister isle from our northern shores, rising proud and defiant against the sky. That land is not foreign to us. It is not strange. It is ours—not by conquest, but by blood.\n\nFor in the highlands of Corsica dwell our brothers, our kin—those who share the tongue of the towers and the rites of the old god. Long have they endured beneath the shadow of the #E Etruscans#!, a people of cunning trade who came not to coexist, but to dominate. Their garrisons line the plains of Alalia, their merchants plunder the forests, their chains press against the necks of free men.\n\nThis must end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_24_task:0 "The Tip Of Corsica"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_24_task_DESC:0 "On the northeast tip of the island—where once only rocks, wind, and scattered Etruscan outposts stood—we have laid the foundation of a great harbor. It is not merely a place for ships to rest; it is a blade thrust into the sea, pointing toward the very heart of Etruria. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil15!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_25_task:0 "Fate of Alalia"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_25_task_DESC:0 "Once a proud port under the yoke of the #E Etruscans#!, it now lies silent beneath the banners of the Sardan. Her walls are blackened with the fire of our siege, her gates torn from their hinges by our war cries, her towers bearing the scars of freedom hard-won. The Etruscan garrison lies broken or scattered across the hills. The harbor, once filled with their sleek ships, now carries only the scent of smoke and salt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_26_task:0 "Develop The North"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_26_task_DESC:0 "With sword and fire, with oath and stone, we have brought unity to the north. For too long, the northern lands of Sardinia were a fractured realm—picked apart by petty Balarian and Corsian kings who crowned themselves in the dark.\n\nYet victory is the beginning, not the end. The northern coasts are wild and empty, their harbors forgotten, their fields overgrown. Great potential lies buried beneath neglect. If we do not build, if we do not settle, if we do not restore what has been lost—then the blood we've spilled will have been for nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil9!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_27_task:0 "Develop The South"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_27_task_DESC:0 "There was a time when the southern of Sardinia—what we call Iliensia—were the heart of our people's power. Before the coming of the Carthaginians, before the rise of foreign altars and foreign laws, these lands were Sardan to their very bone. From the salt of Sulki to the deep harbors of Karali, from the plains of [GetProvince('(int32)3493').GetName] to the sacred stones of Nura, our ancestors ruled not with gold nor decree, but with presence, strength, and wisdom carved in Nuraghe and temple alike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil30!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_28_task:0 "Lesitanian Mines"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_28_task_DESC:0 "With [GetProvince('(int32)3502').GetName] under our banner once more, the mines must live again. Not merely for gold or glory, but because they are ours. They are part of what once made Sardinia feared and respected—from the Pillars of the World to the lands of Peleset. To leave them dormant is to betray what was given to us by the mountain and the underworld alike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil24!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_29_task:0 "Karensian Harbor"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_29_task_DESC:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)3489').GetName] has long stood as a lonely outpost, lashed by waves and forgotten by time. Its cliffs once hosted a simple watchpost, a beacon against raiders and pirates who crossed the narrow sea. But those days are gone. The world grows more connected. Trade flows faster, and with it comes danger, ambition, and opportunity. If the eastern shore is left untended, it will be others—not us—who shape its fate.\n\nA harbor must rise in [GetProvince('(int32)3489').GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil4!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_30_task:0 "Urbanize Balaria"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_30_task_DESC:0 "The time has come to raise a city—a true city—at the mouth of the Nurrensian rivers, where the fields meet the sea and the wind carries both the scent of barley and salt. That place is [GetProvince('(int32)3500').GetName].\n\nThere, the Balarians shall gather not as scattered kin, but as a people. There, trade from the inland valleys may flow outward, and goods from across the sea may enter the heart of the north. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_31_task:0 "Consolidate Balaria"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_31_task_DESC:0 "This is not merely the conquest of land. This is the return of order, of purpose, of legacy. Balaria has not been reshaped—it has been restored to what it was always meant to be: strong, whole, and ours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_32_task:0 "Iolean Plains"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_32_task_DESC:0 "For two hundred years, the Carthaginians took the plain and bled its soil dry with endless tribute. They sowed the land not with seed, but with coin and chain. And when they had stripped it bare—of its crops, its people, its spirit—they left it to rot. For generations, the Iolean Plain has known only the echo of what once was.\n\nBut now, we have returned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic8!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_33_task:0 "The Silver Veins"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_33_task_DESC:0 "For two hundred years they dug deep, taking not only ore, but lives. They turned the wealth of Sardinia into the wealth of Carthage. The tunnels were expanded, yes—but only for their gain. The workers were enslaved, the profits shipped across the sea. When their rule was broken, they left the mines wounded and empty, scarred but unhealed.\n\nNow, they are ours again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_34_task:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)3493').GetName] Reclaimed"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_34_task_DESC:0 "The flame of [GetProvince('(int32)3493').GetName], once dimmed, burns again beneath the sign of the Sardan. The bells ring not for tribute, but for triumph. The people walk freely, not in fear, but in memory.\n\nThis is more than victory—it is vindication. For every elder who remembered [GetProvince('(int32)3493').GetName] as she was. For every child taught to never forget. For every warrior who fell believing she would be free. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic1!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_35_task:0 "Invest In Sarcapos"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_35_task_DESC:0 "Nestled between wind-carved hills and the open blue of the Eastern Sea, [GetProvince('(int32)3486').GetName] was once a modest outpost of the old Sardan world—a small city-state of fishermen, salt-workers, and humble merchants. It was never great in size, nor mighty in walls, yet it endured. And now, after long years of neglect and foreign shadow, it stands once more beneath the banner of the Sardan.\n\nBut mere possession is not enough. [GetProvince('(int32)3486').GetName] must rise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil7!"
 
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_36_task:0 "Consolidate Iliensia"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_36_task_DESC:0 "For generations, the southern lands of Iliensia have known conflict and division. Once home to powerful city-states like [GetProvince('(int32)3493').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)3483').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName], the southern plains were brought low by foreign hands and the weight of subjugation. The Carthaginians sought to erase the heart of Sardinia from memory, but the blood of the Sardan runs too deep in these hills. Now, after years of strife, Iliensia stands as one—unified, restored, and stronger than ever. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

All that are standing outside - not an insignificant number, as a large number of soldiers have been milling about all morning - can thus see for themselves how the negotiations are going.

The belt was draped with five chevrons: only those of the highest martial order—those who could sail in a stormy night, those who killed hundreds of enemies—were allowed such a pattern. And all in the court knew it. Some had only seen such belts buried with the dead.\n\nA local chieftain, yes—but more than that. He was no ordinary man, but it was what he held that stilled even the whisper of silk among the nobles.\n\nIn his outstretched hand lay a golden scarab, its surface etched with the cartouche of Usermaatre Setepenre—the name of Ramses II, the Living God of Kemet. The scarab gleamed with an otherworldly glow, as if it still carried the warmth of the Nile sun.\n\nHospiton raised his voice—not loud, but so filled with weight that it silenced the hall:\n\n“I am Hospiton, son of Agasin, son of Tar-Ammon\nDescendant of the Sardana who crossed the sands\nWho stood beside the Son of Ra\nThis scarab was given to my forefather\nNot as a trinket, but as a seal of kinship.\nWith it, I now seal my oath.”\n\nHe placed the scarab upon the throne's lowest step, then unsheathed his Nuragic dagger—the hilt carved in the sacred gammadion form—and struck its point into the stone beside it.\n\n“By the Light of Il, Father\nBy the blood of my ancestors,\nBy this blade and by this scarab,\nI pledge my life to the King of the Sardan,\nAnd to the rebirth of Sardan's glory.”\n\nNone dared speak. They knew what this meant.
