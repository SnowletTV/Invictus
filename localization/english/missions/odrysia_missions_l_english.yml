 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_DESCRIPTION:0 "A few short years ago, our powerful #E Odrysian#! tribesmen were defeated by the Macedonian general #E Lysimachos of Thrace#!, the tyrant that rules near the Hellespont. Although the treacherous Thracian tyrant believes our will to be broken, we shall repay this hubris by overthrowing our Overlord and proclaiming the rebirth of an independent Odrysia!"

In the following years, he spent much time quelling rebellions and calming the land, leaving the Thracians extremely dissatisfied - something we could capitalize upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 
 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_03:0 "Emissaries To Lysimachos"
 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_03_DESC:0 "Diplomatic relations between Greeks and Thracians are well attested; even Xenophon admits that the Thracians are more civilized than people give them credit for.

 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_04_DESC:0 "Though often referred to as a single people by ancient authors, the land of Thrace was populated by a number of different tribes and kingdoms. And even though there often had been rivalries between them, they also tended to unite against common threats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"

 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_08_DESC:0 "By the beginning of the 3rd Century BCE, many northern Gauls migrated south, wreaking havoc amongst the settled Mediterranean populations of #E Greece#! and #E Anatolia#!. It was these migrations which also brought about the end of the Odrysian people. If our ancestors would have been able to focus properly on defending their northern borders, perhaps they wouldn't have been caught unawares and destroyed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"

 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_09_DESC:0 "A true Thracian would rather die fighting for his freedom than see himself obedient to a foreigner! War seems inevitable if we wish to regain our autonomy, but we are excited for the prospect of battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"

 odrysia_missions_01_freedom_task_11_DESC:0 "Seuthopolis, the founded capital by Seuthes III, was build in Macedonian fashion to centralize the administration of the Oodrysian people. In addition to its administrative purposes, the city also functioned as a religious place.\n\nThough called a polis, Seuthopolis never became a real capital city when compared to the likes of Lysimacheia or Seleucia-Syria, but this will change under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 ### Events and Decisions #
 me_odrysia_finish_1_title:0 "Rekindling The Flame"
 me_odrysia_finish_1_desc:0 "Many years ago, our ruler [GetCharacter('(int32)101').GetName] had lost the fight for our freedom from the Macedonians, much to his everlasting shame. Yet perhaps all is not lost, even though our spirit is broken.\n\nAmidst the scattered ashes of our burnt-down dream of peaceful self-rule, perhaps a spark of our former glory remains, waiting for the right leader to restore it to a raging fire. Will we be able to rekindle it in time to survive the oncoming storm?"
 me_odrysia_finish.1.a:0 "What will the future bring for us?"
 
 me_odrysia_1_title:0 "The Macedonian In The South"
 me_odrysia_1_desc:0 "War is coming! Already the winds are tainted with the stench of death. The generals of [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetName] are fighting their last great battles, and in the northern wastelands there is motion stirring, with rumors of strange and desperate migrations of wandering barbarians upsetting the order of things.\n\nWe are at a crossroad for our survival and have some difficult choices to make - will we abandon our Macedonian overseers and try to reunite the Thracian lands, or will we stand with the Macedonians in their hour of need and forge a new heritage for ourselves?"
 me_odrysia.1.a:0 "We will side with the Macedonians, lest we both be destroyed"
 me_odrysia.1.b:0 "We will fight for our ancestral home!"
 
 me_odrysia_2_title:0 "Becoming The Northern Bulwark"
 me_odrysia_2_desc:0 "We have strengthened our relations with our Macedonian overseers, and thankfully this has brought tangible benefits to the both of us. Now we must unite the rest of Thrace and Moesia under our banner so that we can become the impenetrable shield of Thrace. Our Macedonian Masters have promised to join our fight against the northern tribes, eager for their share of the glory and the plunder. Separated we are weak, but together we will survive."
 me_odrysia.2.a:0 "We will guard the north immediately"
 me_odrysia.2.b:0 "Our current position is adequate"
 
 me_odrysia_mid_2_title:0 "A Demand For Unification"
 me_odrysia_mid_2_desc:0 "The Odrysians, slaves of the Macedonian dogs in the south, have come for our freedom - they demand that we bend the knee, and serve under them as thralls. While this would leave our people in a safer postion, we would also lose all autonomy...but are we truly ready to fight a war?"
 me_odrysia_mid_2.a:0 "Now is the time to unite!"
 me_odrysia_mid_2.b:0 "Traitors! We will carve out their hearts!"
 
 me_odrysia_3_title:0 "Finding A Suitable Bride"
 me_odrysia_3_desc:0 "To cement his control over Odrysia, Seuthes III married a Macedonian woman, Berenike, who some scholars believe to have been a daughter of Lysimachos. In our journey to become equal to our Lysimachid overseers, we want to reinvigorate the bond between our families through a new marriage. The Lysimachids have agreed to give [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] a bride. For this, three suitable candidates have been found for our ruler, who now has the pleasant task of selecting his future mate."
 me_odrysia_3.a:0 "We will go for [potential_wife_1.GetName]"
 me_odrysia_3.b:0 "[potential_wife_2.GetName] seems fine"
 me_odrysia_3.c:0 "Why not [potential_wife_3.GetName]?"
 
 me_odrysia_start_3_title:0 "Negotiating With The Lysimachids"
 me_odrysia_start_3_desc:0 "We have come to the understanding that we are dependent on our Macedonian overlord, but they depend upon us as well - something that pleases us. While they focus their attention to the south, we could turn to the north, becoming the shield of Thrace and securing our mutual prosperity and safety."
 me_odrysia_start.3.a:0 "For the survival of Thrace!"
 
 me_odrysia_mid_3_title:0 "A Proposal From The Odrysians"
 me_odrysia_mid_3_desc:0 " Our ever-so-fickle subjects the Odrysians have come to us with a proposal. They wish to cooperate in the administration and defense of Thrace - not what we were expecting to hear. They agree to remain as our loyal subject and are willing to protect our northern borders, provided we defend the south."
 me_odrysia_mid.3.a:0 "A wonderful idea!"
 me_odrysia_mid.3.b:0 "The Odrysii cannot be trusted."
 
 me_odrysia_finish_3_title:0 "Negotiating With The Lysimachids"
 me_odrysia_finish_3_desc:0 "We want to come to an agreement with our Overlord. There is no need to get overly descriptive with what we are proposing; while they defend southern Thrace, it could be up to us to protect the north. Hopefully they see the wisdom in this."
 me_odrysia_finish.3.a:0 "A sensible agreement."
 
 me_odrysia_4_title:0 "An Unusual Proposal"
 me_odrysia_4_desc:0 "Our troublesome subject, the Odrysians, come bearing an unsuspected proposal; they ask that we join our families together marriage in order to calm the land and lay the path for a peaceful coexistence. Something similar happened after the Odrysian King Seuthes III joined in Callatis's rebellion against Lysimachos in 313 BCE. Berenike, the daughter of our great ruler became Seuthes's wife and helped to mend the divide between ourselves and these pseudo-barbarians to the north. How should we answer this bold proposal from the barbarians?"
 me_odrysia_4.a:0 "What's one more scion if it creates a calmer Thrace!"
 me_odrysia_4.b:0 "Such insolence! Was Berenike not enough for them?"
 
 me_odrysia_start_4_title:0 "Seeking Out Our Brothers"
 me_odrysia_start_4_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a decision to make when it comes to the wars that will soon be upon us - will we look to our brothers for aid? There is a chance that our kinsmen will answer the call to arms, but they could very well ignore us, or wait until we are weakened and then invade us themselves."
 me_odrysia_start.4.a:0 "Let us send the delegations at once"
 me_odrysia_start.4.b:0 "We will fight alone - we need no help"
 
 me_odrysia_mid_4_title:0 "An Offer From The Odrysii"
 me_odrysia_mid_4_desc:0 "The Odrysians, ever tired of their Macedonian masters, wish to form an alliance with us so that we may help them to cast out these foreign invaders and reclaim our land.\n\nThis does sound like a glorious, if not dangerous, request, but it remains to be seen what we shall decide - both options have their merits."
 me_odrysia_mid_4.a:0 "A chance for adventure? Of course we will join"
 me_odrysia_mid_4.b:0 "What do we care about their struggles?"
 
 me_odrysia_start_5_title:0 "A Bond Through Marriage"
 me_odrysia_start_5_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to spend some time on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] personal life by seeking a spouse. It would be a good thing for our people to see our leader happy, so we shall begin searching."
 me_odrysia_start.5.a:0 "Let's find [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] a wife!"
 
 me_odrysia_5_title:0 "An Answer From Our Overlord"
 me_odrysia_5.a:0 "Huzzah! This is worth celebrating"
 me_odrysia_5.b:0 "How dare they!?"
 me_odrysia_5_desc_1:0 "We have received word from our Overlord, who has considered our proposal carefully before responding - they have accepted what we ask."
 me_odrysia_5_desc_2:0 "We have received word from our Overlord, who has considered our proposal carefully before responding - they have declined our request at this time."
 
 me_odrysia_start.6.title:0 "Mustering the Men"
 me_odrysia_start.6.desc:0 "Realizing that we will need every fighting hand that we can get, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to send out the call for troops - they are to gather at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]as soon as they are able to."
 me_odrysia_start.6.a:0 "Fire up the smithies and forge the weapons of war!"
 me_odrysia_finish_6_title:0 "Mustering the Men"
 me_odrysia_finish_6_desc:0 "We are pleased to report that, after a period of consolidation, the levies that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] requested prepare for conflict have been mustered outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Even now, sacrifices are being made to the gods, asking for protection as we prepare to send our soldiers into harm's way."
 me_odrysia_finish.6.a:0 "We are ready for whatever comes"
 
 me_odrysia_7_title:0 "Negotiating With The Greeks"
 me_odrysia_7_desc:0 "We have send our diplomats to the great Greek cities on the coast, asking for their neutrality in the upcoming fight. While nothing is assured, it is our hope that their selfish greed will keep them out of the conflict when the time comes."
 me_odrysia.7.a:0 "Let us hope they dislike the Macedonians as much as we do"
 
 me_odrysia_8_title:0 "An Offer from the Odrysians"
 me_odrysia_8_desc:0 "The Odrysian People, deep in the mountains, have sent us a proposal that we should carefully consider. They wish to fight for their freedom from our common overlord, the Macedonians, and are curious to see if we can combine forces to increase our chances in the war to come. However, they seek no quarrel with us, and are proposing a treaty of non-aggression."
 me_odrysia.8.a:0 "We shall accept!"
 me_odrysia.8.b:0 "And risk retaliation afterwards? Never!"
 
 me_odrysia_9_finish_title:0 "The Thracian War"
 me_odrysia_9_finish_desc:0 "We have declared our independence and have gathered our allies to our side. There is no turning back now; whatever may come, we are willing to fight for our freedom, even if it costs us the lives of our families. We cannot live a life of servitude any longer!"
 me_odrysia_9_finish.a:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)478').GetName] is the home of a free people"
 
 me_odrysia_10_title:0 "An Answer From The Greeks"
 me_odrysia_10_desc:0 "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], I have excellent news regarding the messages we sent to the Greeks. They have accepted our proposal!"
 me_odrysia.10.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_10_title:0 "Subduing The Coast"
 me_odyrsia_finish_10_desc:0 "Not only have we sacked their cities and taken the wealth of the small cities on the coast of the #E Pontus Euxinus#! for ourselves, but we have even achieved a feat that some say is greater - we have discovered many wonderful things amongst the possessions of the defeated cities, including many treatises and diagrams on the construction of powerful #E Siege Engines#!, which we have every intention of putting to good use."
 me_odrysia_finish.10.a:0 "We will bring down the walls of our enemies!"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_11_title:0 "From Court to Capital"
 me_odyrsia_finish_11_desc:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)478').GetName] has long been our central place of administration and diplomacy, but truth be told, it has always been more of a fortress than a true city.\n\nUnder the inspired rule of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], however, we have taken steps to improve our capital. By consolidating more of our scattered population within its walls, we have built something that is starting to resemble a polis."
 me_odrysia_finish_11.a:0 "May it last for a thousand years!"
 
 me_odrysia_11_title:0 "An Answer From The Greeks"
 me_odrysia_11_desc:0 "Well, it must be said that the Greeks live up to their reputation as clever negotiators, for we have not been able to come an agreement about anything."
 me_odrysia.11.a:0 "Preposterous! They will regret this"
 
 me_odrysia_start_12_title:0 "A Divided People"
 me_odrysia_start_12_desc:0 "Now that we are in the position to aid the Odrysian diaspora, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has announced that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will soon give a speech outlining a vision, and all are curious as to what the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has in mind."
 me_odrysia_start.12.a:0 "Let's bring our people home"
 
 me_odrysia_12_title:0 "A Divided People"
 me_odrysia_12_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] recently gave an oration that was reminiscent of the flowery speeches that are heard in Senate Houses of Republics, arguing forcefully in favor of our kinsmen abroad to abandon their lives of slavery and return en masse to the protection of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nWhile many are grateful for this open border policy, there are plenty of people who are indignant - especially [GetCharacter('(int32)41').GetName], who has lodged official complaints at [GetProvince('(int32)478').GetName]"
 me_odrysia.12.a:0 "Only together will we survive"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_13_title:0 "The True Thracian Capital"
 me_odrysia_finish_13_desc:0 "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is known as many things - a capable diplomat, an unmatched warrior and a fierce fighter for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people - few know that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] secretly nurtures a passion for architecture.\n\nAll can witness the grand visions of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] if they visit [GetProvince('(int32)478').GetName], which has been built and shaped to honor the wishes of our leader."
 me_odrysia_finish_13.a:0 "Our people deserve all of this, and more"
 
 me_odrysia_start_14_title:0 "Welcoming Our Macedonian Brothers"
 me_odrysia_start_14_desc:0 "It has been decided that we will develop our connections with the Macedonians, rather than ignore the obvious benefits that working with them could bring to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nIt remains to see how they will respond, but we are hopeful."
 me_odrysia_start.14.a:0 "For Thrace!"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_14_title:0 "Welcoming Our Macedonian Brothers"
 me_odyrsia_finish_14_desc:0 "Now that word has spread far and wide about our intentions to live peacefully with the Macedonians, we are thrilled to report that many of their best fighters have moved to our territories.\n\nIt goes without saying that we now have a skilled body of experienced warriors that we could draw from."
 me_odrysia_finish_14.a:0 "Welcome to the family!"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_15_title:0 "A Kingdom For A King"
 me_odyrsia_finish_15_desc:0 "Although the odds against us were considered insurmountable, somehow [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has managed to repel the powerful forces aligned against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to restore the kingdom that was destroyed long ago.\n\nNow, in our moment of triumph, a grand celebration will take place in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] honoring the eternal achievements of our incomparable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]."

 me_odrysia_finish_16.b:0 "Let them have their freedom - we can't deal with this now"

 me_odrysia_finish_17.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 me_odrysia_finish_18_title:0 "Uncaring Neighbors"
 me_odrysia_finish_18_desc:0 "I am displeased to tell you, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], that our cowardly kinsmen have refused to help our struggle to free our homeland. We stand without their help and will have to fight alone."

 me_odrysia_finish_19_title:0 "Unification Accepted"
 me_odrysia_finish_19_desc:0 "Realizing that the alternative was death and the loss of everything that they hold dear, our thralls have accepted their servitude and submit without defending themselves."
 me_odrysia_finish_19.a:0 "Wonderful! And how pathetic of them..."
 
 me_odrysia_finish_20_title:0 "Unification Denied"
 me_odrysia_finish_20_desc:0 "Our attempt at demanding unification has been met with scorn and threats, with our intended targets warning us to stay in our lands.\n\nI guess this means that we have lost the element of surprise...they will definitely be expecting our soldiers now."

 me_odrysia_finish_23_title:0 "Overlord Declares War"
 me_odrysia_finish_23_desc:0 "Well, if we were hoping to become free without having to fight for it, now we know that this was a foolish dream. Our Overlord has refused our declaration of independence and declared war against us and our allies."
