01_paphlagonia_task_1: "The Paphlagonian Throne"
01_paphlagonia_task_1_DESC: "Having survived a tumultuous history from native rule, to that the Achaemenid satraps, and then to that of the Macedonian strategoi, the Papglagonian throne remains as unstable as any other in the region. Having it occupied by a member of the long-standing line of mythical Pylaemenes should establish some security and stability."
01_paphlagonia_task_1_tt: "The #Y current ruler#!, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], is a member of the #T Pylaemenid#! family. "

01_paphlagonia_task_2: "Sandarake Mines"
01_paphlagonia_task_2_DESC: "Sandarake, also known as red arsenic or realgar, was popularly used to create the medicine (and poison) known as 'bull's blood.' At times it was used for suicide purposes, but it could also counteract other poisonous or decaying ailments, and was highly desireable in the Black Sea and greater Mediterranean. Sometimes it was also just used as an ointment or a pigment for red paint, another popular demand in the eastern Mediterranean. Increasing production in the Amnias river valley mines should ripen the Paphlagonian coffers and enlarge our trade-relationship with neighboring Sinope, the jewel of the Southern Pontos Euxinos."

01_paphlagonia_task_3: "The Paphlagonian-Cappadocian People"
01_paphlagonia_task_3_DESC: "Sharing Northern and Central Anatolia for ages, as long as memory serves, the bond between Paphlagonians and Cappadocians, going as deep as their language, holds strong and encourages them to live together and cooperate. Expanding the eastern border to include more of these friendly and hearty people should lead to a greater internal workforce."
01_paphlagonia_task_3_tt: " #E Paphlagonia#! has #Y integrated#! the #T Cappadocian#! #Y culture#! and has #E enacted#! the #G Patronage#! #Y cultural decision#! for the #T Cappadocian#! #Y culture#!."

01_paphlagonia_task_4: "The Sinope Situation"
01_paphlagonia_task_4_DESC: "The famed Milesian colony to the north has always served as beacon of civilization, trade, wealth, and power in this region of the world. The Paphlagonian economy in-part rests upon that port's success. It would be wise to form closer ties with the city, through diplomacy or conquest."

01_paphlagonia_task_5: "Goat Town"
01_paphlagonia_task_5_DESC: "Some claim that Gangra was founded by the whims of a wandering goat out to pasture. Though this is purely a philological argument posed by outsiders, the secret of its origins will never truly be known. It has sat as the royal residency of Paphlagonian kings and princes since the days of the first Pylaemenes who fought with Ilion. It deserves more care and honor if it is to become a great capital and symbol of the might of the Paphlagonian people."

01_paphlagonia_task_6: "Fortifying The Olgassys Mountains"
01_paphlagonia_task_6_DESC: "Often referred to as inaccessible on account of their lofty and jagged heights, the Olgassys Mountains, running west of the Halys river and following the path of Anatolia's northern coast, provide the people of Paphlagonia with great natural protection in the north, west, and east. In order to ensure the safety of trade routes and to maintain the stability of borders, forts guarding the mountain passes are necessary."

01_paphlagonia_task_7: "Holy Kandara"
01_paphlagonia_task_7_DESC: "Sitting in a great valley between the peaks of the Olgassys range, Kandara has long been a holy site and sees many pilgrims annually who visit the shrine to Her Kandarene for her blessing and favor. It is best to make this town a national treasure, and to expand the grounds upon which people pay reverance to the goddess. For years to come, it may last as a holy and beautiful site."
01_paphlagonia_task_7_t: "#E Hera Kandarene's#! #T holy site#! is in #Y Kandara#!."

01_paphlagonia_task_8: "Securing Sesamos"
01_paphlagonia_task_8_DESC: "A major exporting town of boxwood and other shipping goods, Sesamos has been a wealthy business partner not unlike Sinope. At the periphery of what can be considered 'Paphlagonia,' Sesamos is just within our reach. It would be beneficial to engage more intimately with its markets and politics..."

01_paphlagonia_task_9: "Boxwood Shipbuilding"
01_paphlagonia_task_9_DESC: "Box-tree-clad Kytoros has always sat as a rich port city, a satellite of Sinope, and heavily relies on the rich forests found in the nearby mountains and hills. Using this wealth of strong wood to its utmost potential will allow for the construction of great fleets and a great export economy."

01_paphlagonia_task_10: "Rabbit Town"
01_paphlagonia_task_10_DESC: "Ankyra, a lofty city, has a long and storied history tracing back to years and peoples unknown. Its name, which the Greeks say come from an anchor, which others link to the ancient Hittites, and which even others claim refers to rabbits, remains a puzzle. What is not a puzzle is how successful or a settlement it remains. Its potential for growth depends only on Paphlagonian investment..."

01_paphlagonia_task_11: "The Royal Treasury of Kimiata"
01_paphlagonia_task_11_DESC: "The Macedonians, Achaemenids, and other empires which have ruled over us or nearby have often kept their wealth safe in fortress sites throughout their lands. Kimiata has long been a defensibly advantageous place for the Paphlagonians, being much safer than Gangra or Ankyra, and would provide a great storage facility for the throne's treasury."

01_paphlagonia_task_12: "Paphlagonian Royal Burial"
01_paphlagonia_task_12_DESC: "The royal burial grounds on the modern sites of Salarköy and Donalarköy, long protected by stone animal depictions and vote objects, have fallen into less use while the Paphlagonian throne waned in the face of the Achaemenid and Macedonian threats and rulership. Now, the burial valley may be reclaimed and revitalized in order to reconnect the Paphlagonian throne to its people and land."

01_paphlagonia_task_13: "The Cult of Glycon"
01_paphlagonia_task_13_DESC: "Rumor speaks of an interesting new cult following that has begun in the coastal port-town of Abonuteichos, and the citizens (even the peasants) there clambor for a new temple and furnishings to be added in the city. The most interesting part is that they claim it is all for the second coming of Asclepios."
01_paphlagonia_task_13_t: "A #Y peculiar#! turn of #E events#! is in store for #T Abonuteichos#!..."

01_paphlagonia_task_14: "Hellespontine Phrygia"
01_paphlagonia_task_14_DESC: "Paphlagonia was once ruled from Daskyleion as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia. Retaking those lands and the citadel at Daskyleion should improve Paphlagonian legitimacy on the grand Mediterranean stage, as well as providing the hinterlands with more port-side markets to profit off of in the Aegean."

01_paphlagonia_task_15: "The Amnias and Halys Fields"
01_paphlagonia_task_15_DESC: "The Amnias and Halys rivers, which have fed Paphlagonian fields as far back as generational memory recalls, continue to be the Paphlagonian lifeblood. The overflowing of the rivers' banks should be taken advantage of in order to lead to a prosperous and plentiful future."

01_paphlagonia_task_16: "Master of Asia"
01_paphlagonia_task_16_DESC: "All of Anatolia, Asia, lays before the Paphlagonian throne for the taking. Amid the chaos of the wars of the Diadochoi and the decaying remnants of the old Achaemenid realm, there is finally a place for Paphlagonians to call their own domain - perhaps there is much more for the taking."

01_paphlagonia_task_17: "The Paphlagonian Sea"
01_paphlagonia_task_17_DESC: "The Black Sea has long served as an export market and a means of reaching the wider world. However, Paphlagonian reach has been stifled by the lack of a great navy or of a maritime tradition. Perhaps building a great armada and opening more trading ports shall alter this reality."
