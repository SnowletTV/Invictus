#Missions

01_paphlagonia_task_1: "The Paphlagonian Throne"
01_paphlagonia_task_1_DESC: "Having survived a tumultuous history from native rule, to that the Achaemenid satraps, and then to that of the Macedonian strategoi, the Papglagonian throne remains as unstable as any other in the region. Having it occupied by a member of the long-standing line of mythical Pylaemenes should establish some security and stability."
01_paphlagonia_task_1_tt: "The #Y current ruler#!, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], is a member of the #T Pylaemenid#! family. "

01_paphlagonia_task_2: "Sandarake Mines"
01_paphlagonia_task_2_DESC: "Sandarake, also known as red arsenic or realgar, was popularly used to create the medicine (and poison) known as 'bull's blood.' At times it was used for suicide purposes, but it could also counteract other poisonous or decaying ailments, and was highly desireable in the Black Sea and greater Mediterranean. Sometimes it was also just used as an ointment or a pigment for red paint, another popular demand in the eastern Mediterranean. Increasing production in the Amnias river valley mines should ripen the Paphlagonian coffers and enlarge our trade-relationship with neighboring Sinope, the jewel of the Southern Pontos Euxinos."
