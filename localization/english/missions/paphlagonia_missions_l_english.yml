01_paphlagonia: "Land of Pylaemenes"
01_paphlagonia_DESCRIPTION: "First mentioned in the annals of history during the time of the fabled Trojan War, the Paphlagonians of northern Anatolia have, for as long as is known, been ruled by kings nominally descended from #E Pylaemens#! of the Eneti, who fought to protect the gates of Ilion against Menelaus' and Agamemnon's Mycenaean troops.\n\nDuring the Archaic and Classical Periods, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] found itself changing hands and being loosely controlled by foreign empires including the Phyrgians, Lydians, Achaemenids, and the Macedonians. Their land was a crucial staging ground for the Persian satrap, Datames, as he engaged in the so-called 'Great Satrap Revolt' against Artaxerxes II.\n\nPaphlagonia was best known for being a land of hardy people which contained many temples dotting each hill and mountain - it was a land of worship. As the Diadochi break out in warfare, the local king of Gangra must work to maintain Paphlagonian autonomy and revive the legacy of the Pylaemenid line."
01_paphlagonia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "The mission will be complete when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become the master of Anatolia."

#Missions

01_paphlagonia_task_1: "The Paphlagonian Throne"
01_paphlagonia_task_1_DESC: "Having survived a tumultuous history from native rule, to that the Achaemenid satraps, and then to that of the Macedonian strategoi, the Paphlagonian throne remains as unstable as any other in the region. Having it occupied by a member of the long-standing line of mythical Pylaemenes should establish some security and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
01_paphlagonia_task_1_tt: "The #Y current ruler#!, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], is a member of the #T Pylaemenid#! family. "

01_paphlagonia_task_2: "Sandarake Mines"
01_paphlagonia_task_2_DESC: "Sandarake, also known as red arsenic, is incredibly valuable - let us take steps to increase production of this trade good."
#01_paphlagonia_task_2_DESC: "Sandarake, also known as red arsenic or realgar, was popularly used to create the medicine (and poison) known as 'bull's blood.' At times it was used for suicide purposes, but it could also counteract other poisonous or decaying ailments, and was highly desireable in the Black Sea and greater Mediterranean. Sometimes it was also just used as an ointment or a pigment for red paint, another popular demand in the eastern Mediterranean. Increasing production in the Amnias river valley mines should ripen the Paphlagonian coffers and enlarge our trade-relationship with neighboring Sinope, the jewel of the Southern Pontos Euxinos."

01_paphlagonia_task_3: "The Paphlagonian-Cappadocian People"
01_paphlagonia_task_3_DESC: "Sharing Northern and Central Anatolia for ages, as long as memory serves, the bond between Paphlagonians and Cappadocians, going as deep as their language, holds strong and encourages them to live together and cooperate. Expanding the eastern border to include more of these friendly and hearty people should lead to a greater internal workforce."
01_paphlagonia_task_3_tt: " #E Paphlagonia#! has #Y integrated#! the #T Cappadocian#! #Y culture#! and has #E enacted#! the #G Patronage#! #Y cultural decision#! for the #T Cappadocian#! #Y culture#!."

01_paphlagonia_task_4: "The Sinope Situation"
01_paphlagonia_task_4_DESC: "The famed Milesian colony to the north has always served as beacon of civilization, trade, wealth, and power in this region of the world. The Paphlagonian economy in-part rests upon that port's success. It would be wise to form closer ties with the city, through diplomacy or conquest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

01_paphlagonia_task_5: "Goat Town"
01_paphlagonia_task_5_DESC: "Some claim that Gangra was founded by the whims of a wandering goat out to pasture. Though this is purely a philological argument posed by outsiders, the secret of its origins will never truly be known. It has sat as the royal residency of Paphlagonian kings and princes since the days of the first Pylaemenes who fought with Ilion. It deserves more care and honor if it is to become a great capital and symbol of the might of the Paphlagonian people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
gangra_gets_goodies_for_paph_tt: "#Y Gangra#! will become a#! #T Metropolis#! #Y and many of our elites will move there#!."

01_paphlagonia_task_6: "Fortifying The Olgassys Mountains"
01_paphlagonia_task_6_DESC: "Often referred to as inaccessible on account of their lofty and jagged heights, the Olgassys Mountains, running west of the Halys river and following the path of Anatolia's northern coast, provide the people of Paphlagonia with great natural protection in the north, west, and east. In order to ensure the safety of trade routes and to maintain the stability of borders, forts guarding the mountain passes are necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

01_paphlagonia_task_7: "Holy Kandara"
01_paphlagonia_task_7_DESC: "Sitting in a great valley between the peaks of the Olgassys range, Kandara has long been a holy site and sees many pilgrims annually who visit the shrine to Her Kandarene for her blessing and favor. It is best to make this town a national treasure, and to expand the grounds upon which people pay reverance to the goddess. For years to come, it may last as a holy and beautiful site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

01_paphlagonia_task_8: "Securing Sesamos"
01_paphlagonia_task_8_DESC: "A major exporting town of boxwood and other shipping goods, Sesamos has been a wealthy business partner not unlike Sinope. At the periphery of what can be considered 'Paphlagonia,' Sesamos is just within our reach. It would be beneficial to engage more intimately with its markets and politics...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

01_paphlagonia_task_9: "Boxwood Shipbuilding"
01_paphlagonia_task_9_DESC: "Box-tree-clad Kytoros has always sat as a rich port city, a satellite of Sinope, and heavily relies on the rich forests found in the nearby mountains and hills. Using this wealth of strong wood to its utmost potential will allow for the construction of great fleets and a great export economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil7!"

01_paphlagonia_task_10: "Rabbit Town"
01_paphlagonia_task_10_DESC: "Ankyra, a lofty city, has a long and storied history tracing back to years and peoples unknown. Its name, which the Greeks say come from an anchor, which others link to the ancient Hittites, and which even others claim refers to rabbits, remains a puzzle. What is not a puzzle is how successful or a settlement it remains. Its potential for growth depends only on Paphlagonian investment...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"

01_paphlagonia_task_11: "The Royal Treasury Of Kimiata"
01_paphlagonia_task_11_DESC: "The Macedonians, Achaemenids, and other empires which have ruled over us or nearby have often kept their wealth safe in fortress sites throughout their lands. Kimiata has long been a defensibly advantageous place for the Paphlagonians, being much safer than Gangra or Ankyra, and would provide a great storage facility for the throne's treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

01_paphlagonia_task_12: "Paphlagonian Royal Burial"
01_paphlagonia_task_12_DESC: "The royal burial grounds on the modern sites of Salarköy and Donalarköy, long protected by stone animal depictions and vote objects, have fallen into less use while the Paphlagonian throne waned in the face of the Achaemenid and Macedonian threats and rulership. Now, the burial valley may be reclaimed and revitalized in order to reconnect the Paphlagonian throne to its people and land."

01_paphlagonia_task_13: "The Cult Of Glycon"
01_paphlagonia_task_13_DESC: "Rumor speaks of an interesting new cult following that has begun in the coastal port-town of Abonuteichos, and the citizens (even the peasants) there clambor for a new temple and furnishings to be added in the city. The most interesting part is that they claim it is all for the second coming of Asclepios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
01_paphlagonia_task_13_t: "A #Y peculiar#! turn of #E events#! is in store for #T Abonuteichos#!..."

01_paphlagonia_task_14: "Hellespontine Phrygia"
01_paphlagonia_task_14_DESC: "Paphlagonia was once ruled from Daskyleion as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia. During the campaign of Alexander the Great in 334 BC, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Arsites, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Granicus River, after which he committed suicide. Alexander appointed Calas as his successor. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, a member of the royal house of Lyncestis in Macedonia and one of Alexander's trusted bodyguards. Alexander's sister Cleopatra, the widow of King Alexander I of Epirus, offered her hand in marriage to Leonnatus, a union that would have strengthened his claim to power. Had he defeated the Athenians, Leonnatus may very well have attempted to seize the Macedonian throne for himself. His career was cut short during the Lamian War, where he led a force of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to relieve Antipater during the siege of Lamia. Despite his likely ambitions to challenge Antipater's authority and potentially marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra, Leonnatus was killed in battle, leaving his aspirations unfulfilled. The satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia has been defunct ever since the death of Leonnatus.\n\nRetaking those lands and the citadel at Daskyleion should improve Paphlagonian legitimacy on the grand Mediterranean stage, as well as providing the hinterlands with more port-side markets to profit off of in the Aegean."

01_paphlagonia_task_15: "The Amnias And Halys Fields"
01_paphlagonia_task_15_DESC: "The Amnias and Halys rivers, which have fed Paphlagonian fields as far back as generational memory recalls, continue to be the Paphlagonian lifeblood. The overflowing of the rivers' banks should be taken advantage of in order to lead to a prosperous and plentiful future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

01_paphlagonia_task_16: "Master Of Asia"
01_paphlagonia_task_16_DESC: "All of Anatolia, Asia, lays before the Paphlagonian throne for the taking. Amid the chaos of the wars of the Diadochi and the decaying remnants of the old Achaemenid realm, there is finally a place for Paphlagonians to call their own domain - perhaps there is much more for the taking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil17!"

01_paphlagonia_task_17: "The Paphlagonian Sea"
01_paphlagonia_task_17_DESC: "The Black Sea has long served as an export market and a means of reaching the wider world. However, Paphlagonian reach has been stifled by the lack of a great navy or of a maritime tradition. Perhaps building a great armada and opening more trading ports shall alter this reality."

01_paphlagonia_task_18: "Tattan Salt"
01_paphlagonia_task_18_DESC: "Sitting at the center of the Central Anatolian Plateau, lake Tatta has long been an outlier. Birds which dips their wings in it while flying by are said to have had their feathers crystalize. Salt keeps food fresh and exportable, so it would be best to take advantage of the salt mining opportunity that the lake presents."

01_paphlagonia_task_19: "The Throne Of Midas"
01_paphlagonia_task_19_DESC: "Given the growing worship of Midas among the people of Ankyra and beyond, it seems vital to continue the throne's popularity by taking over and renovating the ancient capital of that age-old king, the site of Gordion. Doing so shall grant Paphlagonia the legitimacy of the Midas dynasty."

01_paphlagonia_task_20: "Legacy Of The Hatti"
01_paphlagonia_task_20_DESC: "The search for anciennt relics from a bygone civilization has led Paphlagonian researchers and treasure-hunters alike to the heart of the Central Anatolian Plateau. They found undatable city remains and old sages who spoke of a people from time immemoriable. In order to further illuminate this mystery, and to benefit from the popularity the region has gained from the ancient mystery, it would be beneficial to settle the place further."

01_paphlagonia_task_21: "The Reign Of Glycon"
01_paphlagonia_task_21_DESC: "The fame of the cult of Glycon and its oracle have spread far and wide. Individuals both rich and poor have searched for advice at the formerly forgettable port town of Abonuteichos. As a kingdom, Paphlagonia has become synonymous with Glycon and his cult, and it seems almost as if the cult rules all Paphlagonia at this point. Perhaps it is simply best to feed into the cult and embrace its societal stranglehold."

me_paphlagonia_12.b: "Call up the armies of Paphlagonia."
me_paphlagonia_12.c: "Yes...use your anger...let the hate flow through you."

me_paphlagonia_13_desc: "The tree-cutters and those most deity-fearing of the port town of [GetProvince('(int32)206').GetName] have sent messages to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] asking for funds to create a shrine up in the mountain peaks to [GetDeityDefinition('omen_kytioros').GetName], the son of Phrixus and the namesake of the town itself. Shall the throne aid the boxwood-driven economic region?"
me_paphlagonia_13.a: "Kytioros deserves sacrifices!"
me_paphlagonia_13.b: "Our coffers cannot afford this."

me_paphlagonia_14_desc: "Out on a walk with his advisors, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] once again finds an animal by the roadside with no clear owner or purpose... a lone rabbit. One of the advisors, a nobleman from Ankyra, states that, like with the aging royal goat, taking the rabbit as a pet should make the people of Ankyra happy with the king, for the rabbit is supposedly their namesake. What shall we do?"
me_paphlagonia_14.a: "Who knew rabbits could be royalty."
me_paphlagonia_14.b: "That looks like a killer rabbit!"

me_paphlagonia_15_title: "The Rule of Midas"
me_paphlagonia_15_desc: "The people of Ankyra, although they cannot fathom it, remain convinced that the ancient king, Midas of Phrygia, built their city from the ground. So it is recorded in the annals, even though the place seems much older and richer in history. What do we know anyway...The people of Ankyra wish to build a temple to the old king, with the hopes that they might gain his heavenly protection and guidance in the future. Shall we allow this?"
me_paphlagonia_15.a: "Let Midas' golden touch shower the city in riches."
me_paphlagonia_15.b: "A dead king of a foreign land has little value to us."

me_paphlagonia_16_title: "Hatti Relics" 
me_paphlagonia_16_desc: "Digging around some old mudflats, villagers outside the Ankyra city markets found some tools which were quite old. Soon enough, more and more artefacts from ages past came in. Surely, Midas was not the true founder of this place if such ancient things can be found here. The styles, designs, and manufacturing seem strangely familiar, but also completely alien. The gold, silver, and other metal pieces are particularly puzzling and fascinating. What shall we do with it all?"
me_paphlagonia_16.a: "Follow the trail of these artifacts..."
me_paphlagonia_16.b: "Let our brightest mind study them."
me_paphlagonia_16.c: "They are but toys of the past - nothing special."

No expense was deemed too great, for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wanted to secure the many valuable possessions that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family has accumulated over the years. Walls were made to be doubly thick, and the vaults themselves are deep within the citadel. Kimiata's engineers have promised the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] talents of gold and silver, as well as the countless jewels owned by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], will be safe within Kimiata's walls."

me_paphlagonia_18_desc: "With the valley of Paphlagonian royal tombs finally renovated, those who regularly visit to pay tribute have wished to create a votive shrine to our oldest ancestor and leader, Pylaemenes of the Enetoi himself, who forged out Paphlagonian desitny in the tablets of history. Surely, we can honor him with a symbolic structure."
me_paphlagonia_18.a: "The Pylaemenid line thrives off of his legacy."
me_paphlagonia_18.b: "Let the modern Pylaemenids be the ones worshiped."

me_paphlagonia_19_title: "A Second Coming"
me_paphlagonia_19_desc: "There is a man wandering the streets of [GetProvince('(int32)1815').GetName] who claims that a second coming of the god [GetDeityDefinition('omen_asclepius').GetName], the lord of Greek medicine and healing, is imminent, but work must be done before the god reveals himself. The people in that place are begging for funds to renovate their temple in preparation for the god's arrival. Similar rumors about Asklepios have taken place before, so our advisors are not in agreement over the truth of this claim. Shall we aid the villagers?"
me_paphlagonia_19.a: "Of course we shall help prepare for the god's coming!"
me_paphlagonia_19.b: "I don't believe the investment will be helpful."

me_paphlagonia_20_title: "The Snake Oracle" 
me_paphlagonia_20_desc: "The time has come. A man named Alexander of [GetProvince('(int32)1815').GetName] has come forth with the news that the reincarnation of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_asclepius').GetName] himself has been born within the walls of his hometown. The prophetic man now resides within the town's new temple, in an oracular chamber which remains hazy with smoking incense and levels of drapes and curtains. They say that a snake sits upon his shoulders, but the snake takes on the head of a man, speaking with the voice of the healing god.\n\nAll who have gone to see the snake deity have professed that the god is real, and they have found fortune in its oracular phrases. What shall be done about this?" 
me_paphlagonia_20.a: "A heavenly being resides in our land - rejoice!"
me_paphlagonia_20.b: "A talking snake...I wasn't born yesterday."

me_paphlagonia_21_title: "In the Name of Glycon" 
me_paphlagonia_21_desc: "Our people have really taken to the worship of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_glycon').GetName], for the veneration of the Snake has quickly become the most popular religion within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. It is almost as if a state of madness has gripped their minds, for the only thing that is spoken of in the streets is the name of Glycon - everyone is convinced that the blessings of the Serpent have been given to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nPetitions have been sent to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that beg our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] to officially embrace the Serpent and remake ourselves in his image. Is this a step the Paphlagonian people are willing to take - to shed their skin for the scales of Glycon?"
me_paphlagonia_21.a: "All shall despair of the muscles of the invincible Glycon!"
me_paphlagonia_21.b: "All shall despair of the muscles of the invincible Glycon!"
me_paphlagonia_21.c: "An oracular capital will bring good fortunes."
me_paphlagonia_21.d: "Glycon is but a part of Paphlagonia - its name remains with the cult."

me_paphlagonia_22_title: "A New Paphlagonian Entity"
me_paphlagonia_22_desc: "Now that we control the entirety of the former satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia and have become something of a respectable power in this part of the world, it is fitting that we alter our cherished nation's title to be something more notable, something fierce, and something both our enemies and allies will not fail to remember."
me_paphlagonia_22.a: "We shall reinstitute the Hellespontine Satrapy government in full."
me_paphlagonia_22.b: "We have become something more than Paphlagonia, something...greater."
me_paphlagonia_22.c: "People should recognize the power our throne wields."

me_paphlagonia_23_desc: "Our efforts to increase the yields of our farms has been a smashing success. The rushing waters of the #E Halys#! and #E Amnias#! have been diverted into irrigation canals, which are tended to by small armies of slaves that are specially trained in agricultural techniques.

me_paphlagonia_25_desc: "With greater access to the sea, our ports have become bustling hubs of economic gain.

me_paphlagonia_26_desc: "With the recent gains and popularity earned from the salt trade around lake Tatta, merchantmen have began setting up small hamlets around the lake shores for more permanent business affairs.

me_paphlagonia_27.b: "Our home is in Paphlagonia."

me_paphlagonia_28_desc: "Researchers and historians in the Paphlagonian realm and abroad have discovered an ancient, vibrant people known as the Hatti who lived in what people call Cappadocia. They appear to have built grand cities and traded with the oldest of peoples. Assyrian merchants and magicians who still roam Mesopotamia and Anatolia speak of their ancient practices and have begun selling information about their way of life. The Paphlagonians and other ethne among the Anatolians see these Hatti as a common group they believe they can harken back to.\n\nAs much as it may seem extreme, our advisors have suggested the possibility of unifying all the peoples we have conquered by reinvigorating these ancient peoples and taking on their legacy. What shall we do?"
me_paphlagonia_28.a: "We shall bring back the ways of the Hatti but maintain our faith"
me_paphlagonia_28.b: "Their gods may hold secrets we have only dreamed of..."
me_paphlagonia_28.c: "This is nothing but a researcher's fantasy."
