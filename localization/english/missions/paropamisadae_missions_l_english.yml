 paropamisadae_missions:0 "Path of the Paropamisus"
 paropamisadae_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Paropamisadaean realm is ruled by the old King, Oxyartes. He has seen the fall of the Persians, the rise of #E Alexander#!, the marriage of #E Roxana#! to #E Alexander#!, and the death of both all before he himself passes away. He has ruled his land relatively independently, yet, all may be lost with the #E Diadochi#! meddling in eastern affairs. He must secure his dynasty, secure his realm, and then secure his place in history."
 paropamisadae_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Paropamisadae has decided her fate."
 paropamisadae_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Scale the #E Paropamisus#! Mountains."
 
 #Missions
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_1:0 "Secure Succession"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The death of Roxana was dissapointing to all in Bactria and Sogdia, yet, she will not be where the noble line ends. We must make sure that there is an heir and that they will grow up strong and prepared for the future tribulations of our country."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_2:0 "Training the Next Generation"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "The future of our people is the ultimate goal. In his wise age, Oxyartes understood this, and thus, we should make sure to spend resources for the next generation."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_3:0 "Fit for a King"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Our nation occupies a vast stretch of land across the mountains. We must choose where the seat of the capital will be, as well as the regional capital in the region we do not pick as our primary city."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_4:0 "A Strong Dynasty"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "With preparations for the future of the nation secured, we may rest easy knowing the next years, provided no unexpected death, will be smooth sailing... or... hiking?"
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_5:0 "Distant Diadochi"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "As we are so distant and very powerful in our position, we can easily stop participating in these Diadochi wars. We need not to even send notice, the Seleukids will figure it out on their own when ouor tribute does not arrive."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_6:0 "Eastern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "Trade in the east is rich in silk and profits. Let us try and further foster this trade relation with nations distant and mysterious."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_7:0 "Southern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "The land of India is rich in spices and knowledge, and trade routes to the subcontinent have been around far before even the Persians arrived."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_8:0 "Western Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Although we are distant from the Macedonian warlords, we would certainly still benefit from the trade established by the Persians!"
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_9:0 "The Next Step"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "We are at an incredibly diverse crossroads of the world. This leaves us with plenty of options on how to continue onwards. Towards the ancestral homelands of Oxyartes', towards the rich lands of India, towards the dynastic claims of Roxana, or even simply staying here in this land of Sattagydians."
 
 # Macedonian Route
 paropamisadae_missions_task_10:0 "Claims Against Cassander"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Roxana and her child were unjustly murdered and the throne stolen by Cassander. This is more than enough reason for us to claim the throne for ourselves."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_11:0 "Prepare the Journey"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Macedon is a land so far, many of us have hardly any conception what it may be like. We must prepare food, equipment, and translators-as well as any additional people we may find useful in this distant land."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_12:0 "Sympathizers and Supporters"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "We will have the option to search for friends and allies in both Greek, Persian, and Indian circles, however, the more we take, the more difficult it will be to pay them all."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_task_13:0 "A Legendary March"
 paropamisadae_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "This march will surely be a long and arduous one, and legends will be written about it. We must say goodbye to our homes in the mountains, and set out. May Vaksh protect us."
