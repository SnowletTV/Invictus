 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence:0 "Paths of the Paropamisus"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Paropamisadaean realm is ruled by the old King, Oxyartes. He has seen the fall of the Persians, the rise of #E Alexander#!, the marriage of #E Roxana#! to #E Alexander#!, and the death of both all before he himself passes away. He has ruled his land relatively independently, yet, all may be lost with the #E Diadochi#! meddling in eastern affairs. He must secure his dynasty, secure his realm, and then secure his place in history."
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Paropamisadae has decided her fate."
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Scale the #E Paropamisus#! Mountains."
 
 #Missions
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_1:0 "Mountain Merchants"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_1_DESC:0 "The Paropamisus Mountains are positioned well for trade. We need to start taking advantage of our position before others beat us to it."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_2:0 "Training the Next Generation"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_2_DESC:0 "The future of our people is the ultimate goal. In his wise age, Oxyartes understood this, and thus, we should make sure to spend resources for the next generation."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_3:0 "Fit for a King"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_3_DESC:0 "Our nation occupies a vast stretch of land across the mountains. We must choose where the seat of the capital will be, whether it be a new city or an old city. Whatever our choice, we shall truly make it a capital fit for a king."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_4:0 "A Strong Dynasty"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_4_DESC:0 "The death of Roxana was dissapointing to all in Bactria and Sogdia, yet, she will not be where the noble line ends. We must make sure that there is an heir and that they will grow up strong and prepared for the future tribulations of our country."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_5:0 "Distant Diadochi"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_5_DESC:0 "As we are so distant and very powerful in our position, we can easily stop participating in these Diadochi wars. We need not to even send notice, the Seleukids will figure it out on their own when our tribute does not arrive."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_6:0 "Eastern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_6_DESC:0 "Trade in the east is rich in silk and profits. Let us try and further foster this trade relation with nations distant and mysterious."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_7:0 "Southern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_7_DESC:0 "The land of India is rich in spices and knowledge, and trade routes to the subcontinent have been around far before even the Persians arrived."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_8:0 "Western Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_8_DESC:0 "Although we are distant from the Macedonian warlords, we would certainly still benefit from the trade established by the Persians!"
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_9:0 "The Next Step"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_9_DESC:0 "We are at an incredibly diverse crossroads of the world. This leaves us with plenty of options on how to continue onwards. Towards the ancestral homelands of Oxyartes', towards the rich lands of India, towards the dynastic claims of Roxana, or even simply staying here in this land of Sattagydians."

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_10:0 "Mountains of Metals"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_10_DESC:0 "Our armies need funding, and what better way than to exploit the mountains of precious metals that sit on the rocks we live amongst. This may cause temporary #R inflation#! of #Y Precious Metals#!, but it will benefit us in the long term."

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_11:0 "A Royal Army"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_11_DESC:0 "With all our preparations met, we should standardize the army like the #E Diadochi#! and #E Alexander#! did, as well as the #E Achaemenids#!. We will follow suit."

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_12:0 "Land of Lapis"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_12_DESC:0 "Since the #T Age of Bronze#!, these mountains were famed for their production of #Y Lapis Lazuli#!. The wonderful blue stone enrich us beyond what gold or silver could ever."

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_13:0 "Ensure Grain Supply"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_13_DESC:0 "Although there are many advantages to our base here in the mountains, one of those advantages certainly is not an abundance of farmland. We must secure a supply of grain, lest our soldiers and citizenry starve when times become dire."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_14:0 "Center of the Silk Road"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_14_DESC:0 "Goods originating from #E China#! are ending up all the way at #E Rome#! and beyond. We are somehow equidistant from both these civilizations, allowing us to profit off of this trade well as middlemen."

 # Macedonian Route
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_1:0 "Claims Against Cassander"
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_1_DESC:0 "Roxana and her child were unjustly murdered and the throne stolen by Cassander. This is more than enough reason for us to claim the throne for ourselves."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_2:0 "Prepare the Next Generation"
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_2_DESC:0 "The distant land of Macedon must welcome us with open arms. We need to prepare our children for the long and arduous journey, and make sure that their generation will be able to rule a foreign entity."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_3:0 "Sympathizers and Supporters"
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_3_DESC:0 "We will have the option to search for friends and allies in both Greek, Persian, and Indian circles, however, the more we take, the more difficult it will be to pay them all.\n\nIn order to pay for everything we will need #Y 100#! political influence, #Y 1000#! gold, and #Y 2000#! manpower."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_4:0 "A Legendary March"
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_4_DESC:0 "This march will surely be a long and arduous one, and legends will be written about it. We must say goodbye to our homes in the mountains, and set out. May Vaksh protect us."
