 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence:0 "Paths of the Paropamisus"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Paropamisadaean realm is ruled by the old King, Oxyartes. He has seen the fall of the Persians, the rise of #E Alexander#!, the marriage of #E Roxana#! to #E Alexander#!, and the death of both all before he himself passes away. He has ruled his land relatively independently, yet, all may be lost with the #E Diadochi#! meddling in eastern affairs. He must secure his dynasty, secure his realm, and then secure his place in history."
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Paropamisadae has decided her fate."
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Scale the #E Paropamisus#! Mountains."

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_1_DESC:0 "The death of Roxana was dissapointing to all in Bactria and Sogdia, yet, she will not be where the noble line ends.

 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_4_DESC:0 "With preparations for the future of the nation secured, we may rest easy knowing the next years, provided no unexpected death, will be smooth sailing... or... hiking?"
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_5:0 "Distant Diadochi"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_5_DESC:0 "As we are so distant and very powerful in our position, we can easily stop participating in these Diadochi wars. We need not to even send notice, the Seleukids will figure it out on their own when ouor tribute does not arrive."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_6:0 "Eastern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_6_DESC:0 "Trade in the east is rich in silk and profits. Let us try and further foster this trade relation with nations distant and mysterious."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_7:0 "Southern Trade"
 paropamisadae_missions_1_independence_task_7_DESC:0 "The land of India is rich in spices and knowledge, and trade routes to the subcontinent have been around far before even the Persians arrived."

Towards the ancestral homelands of Oxyartes', towards the rich lands of India, towards the dynastic claims of Roxana, or even simply staying here in this land of Sattagydians."
 
 # Macedonian Route

 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_1_DESC:0 "Roxana and her child were unjustly murdered and the throne stolen by Cassander. This is more than enough reason for us to claim the throne for ourselves."

 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_2_DESC:0 "The distant land of Macedon must welcome us with open arms. We need to prepare our children for the long and arduous journey, and make sure that their generation will be able to rule a foreign entity."
 
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_3:0 "Sympathizers and Supporters"
 paropamisadae_missions_2_macedon_task_3_DESC:0 "We will have the option to search for friends and allies in both Greek, Persian, and Indian circles, however, the more we take, the more difficult it will be to pay them all.\n\nIn order to pay for everything we will need #Y 100#! political influence, #Y 1000#! gold, and #Y 2000#! manpower."
