 patauion_mission_02_DESCRIPTION: "From our modest city we look out across the Plains of the Padan, seeing a vast landscape huddled by distant mountain ranges, calling to us with the serene winds and sunlight shining across these barbarian-filled lands. And to our south we see the vast Adriatic sea, across which lies the land from where we had come from, with a legacy that we are within our full right to one day reclaim.\nHowever, with great enemies having amassed power during our time of turbulance, these will be testing years for our dear city.\n\nWill Patauion fall to barbarian hordes, or will our city rise to dominate all of the lands within our sights?"

 patauion_mission_02_task_1_DESC: "The situation in our capital has stabilized, and we are now free to look beyond our immediate borders, which seem to be alarmingly small. We must push the borders of Patauion outwards - and give our city some breathing space for both growth, and defence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_2_DESC: "Since arriving in these lands, the local Venetic tribes have been a constant thorn in our side. Constantly harrasing us, and attempting to push us back out of our city. If we are to secure our position, we must finish off the independent Veneti once and for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_3_DESC: "These local plains are fertile and opportunous, with far greater extent for farmlands than mountainous Hellas. However with this new opportunity comes a new threat, for the plains of the Padan are filled with fearsome Celtoi warriors, with weapons and armour that at many times serve as a foil to our own. We must learn how to fight these Celtoi - for these fertile Padanian lands must be ours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil12!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_4_DESC: "Through fierce fighting, both these Celtic warriors, and our own, have shown great prowess, however it is us Patauians who are turning the tide. By the might of Ares, let us push our borders further, and continue our march against the Celtoi so that the whole vally of the Padan falls entirely under our control!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil13!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_5_DESC: "Our long fight against the Celtoi has brought us into contact with yet another people, the stubborn and unyielding Ligurians. If we manage to conquer them, they will likely always try to resist our rule. However, if they were forcefully distributed, they may be better controlled - besides, we are in need of more Helots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil20!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_6_DESC: "In our fight to secure the borders of our new homeland, few threaten us more than the bellicose Senonni. Famed for having demonstrated brutality in their sacking of the Latins, we know that they possess both the will to plunder those settlements and cities they see as wealthy, and the martial prowess to carry out their campaigns. Well they are not the only invaders here who know how to fight - a quick preemptive strike against these adversaries is in our best interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_7_DESC: "So focused were we on our internal problems upon arriving upon these shores that we neglected to gaze upon the conflicts deep within the peninsula, and now it appears that our negeligance is here to bite us back. Now a powerful threat emerges to our south, ready to conquer all in its path. If we are to succeed in the coming conflicts with the Italic barbarians, we must be willing to act aggressively - and show no mercy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil29!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_8_DESC: "In glorious battle, we have slowly pushed back the Italics, sacking and burning as we go so that these barbarians may be broken. Now we are at the very gates of their capital. If we are to take it we could permanently disable the barbarian threat from the south - by razing it to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil21!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_9_DESC: "South of the Gallic lands lie the hills of the pastoralist Umbrians. These survivours of the Deluge are disunited and, inhabiting the stategic Appenine hills that could be used to guard our lands in the Padanian Vally, are a prime target for our expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_10_DESC: "We have taken the northern hills of the Appenines, and from here we can see that the centre of this peninsula is filled with squabbling barbarian tribes. Some are herders, others have fashioned a semblance of our own civilization by building cities with Hellenic inspiration. What we are certain of is that these states pose a threat as long as they are left alone to consolidate - we must take the rest of the Appenine states into our own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil2!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_11_DESC: "Our expansion across Italia has slowly seen us quickly one of the most powerful states in the region, of great surprise to even ourselves! It would therefore be opportune to take advantage of our current position to take full hegemony over the Italics. We, the Patauians, can become the masters of this barbarian peninsula!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_12_DESC: "It has now been many years since we left our Hellenic homeland, and yet we have not forgotten our roots. We come from a long line of legendary Spartan Kings and warriors - It is time that we reclaim our heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_13_DESC: "Our sights are now set on our old homeland, but a great obstacle stands between us and our ambition, the great Adriatic Sea, of which we crossed to come here. Of course, it shouldn't be a problem to return the way we came, but we do need to rebuild a fleet first...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_14_DESC: "In our mission to aquire an invasion fleet, we are running into a problem of a lack of experience in shipbuilding, having gone so many years without a functioning navy. But this is not without a solution - If we are to cosy up to the pirates of Illyria, we may be able to by their ships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_15_DESC: "When we set out on our journey towards Italia, our first stop had been a city in Apulia called 'Thuriae'. Though we had managed to take it, we where pushed back out by the Romans and had to set sail once again. Looking out across the Adriatic, our memory of Thuriae does surface once again, for it would make a good base from which to stage an invasion of Hellas - We should assemble a force to recapture the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_16_DESC: "During his adventures, our forefather, Kleonymos, made many friends and enemies, one of them being the Tarantians. While he had come to their aid in their war against the Lucanians, they trecherously abandoned him, forcing Kleonymos to turn back to Sparta. Now that the city is within our own sights, there are those among us that propose that we now right this historical slight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_17_DESC: "The Greek polies of southern Italia now look to our burgeoning kingdom with fear, and for good reason. The lands of Megale Hellas to our south are rich, and disunited - they are prime for the taking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_18_DESC: "Long ago, as our forefather Kleonymos set on his first expedition across the Adriatic, he had siezed the island of Korkyra for a time to secure his power in the region. Though our ancestors lost their hold on the island, it remains a strateigic foothold for anyone trying to cross this Adriatic sea. It would do us well to conquer the island once again, so that we may facilitate our expedition eastwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_19_DESC: "The Epirotes have proven themselves great and ambitious strategists, and their king, Pyrros, has shown himself to be extremely dangerous to those who show he opposes. But what of his allies?\nWe should seek to ally the Epirote kings - and have their martial prowess on our side in our upcoming invasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_20_DESC: "After many years away from our old homeland, the Peloponnese is once again in our sights! It is time for us to once again tread on these hellenic shores - and establish a foothold from which we can start our glorious reconquest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil30!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_21_DESC: "The Messenians have been an affront to the Spartan heritage ever since they were freed by Epaminondas. Long the enemies of our ancestors, it was a great vitory to have made them into helots so long ago. Now that our armies are at their borders, it is time to put them back into the bondage that they so rightfuly deserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_22_DESC: "In the north-western Peloponnese lies the famed Temple of Zeus, a true wonder built in the town of Olympia, seat of the Olympic games. Benevolent control over such a famed site would bring great legitimacy to our rule within Hellas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_23_DESC: "After many decades of planning, we now look upon the outskirts of the city of our ancestors, the mighty Sparta. It is time that we take our rightful city for ourselves!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_24_DESC: "The descendents of Areus are on their final breaths on the throne of the Spartans, and our control over the lands of the kingdom is becoming inevitable. We must cast out these illegitimate pretenders - for the throne of Sparta rightfuly belongs to the descendents of Kleonymos!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_25_DESC: "As we defeat the strugling vestiges of the old Kingdom that we left not so long ago, our rightful rule over our ancestral lands becomes evermore apparent. Once the remains of the old Spartan Kingdom, led by the descendents of Areus, Patauion will be proven to be the new real centre of Doric power!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_26_DESC: "We have succeded in our long-held goal of establishing ourselves securely in our old homeland, and have usurped power over the kingdom which we once called home. But now is the time to extend our power, so that we may grow to compete even the Macedonian overlords to our north. Once we have dominated the Peloponnesian coast, the inland polies of Arcadia will surly submit to our growing might.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"
 patauion_mission_02_task_27_DESC: "Through these trials of warfare, we have truly proven ourselves worthy of our Spartan heritage, and have grown from being outcasts and pretenders in our homeland, running off to find prospects in barbarian lands, to rulers of one of the most powerful states in Hellas. But in itself this is not yet enough. We must look to overshadow even the accomplishments of our Spartan ancestors - We will grow to become a Hellenic hegemon, the likes of which Hellas has never seen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
