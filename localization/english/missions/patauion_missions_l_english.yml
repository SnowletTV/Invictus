While we set out for glory, we where unsure where our voyage across the Adriatic Sea would take us, upon seeing the riches of Patauion however, we desired to take them into our Laemacedonian hands. Now, with our victory won, Kleonymos has decided to use the opportunity to forge a new kingdom for us, with his comerades as his new Spartan nobility. But not all is well in our kingdom of Patauion.\n\nOutraged at being disenfranchised, the local Patavi look upon us with utter contempt, refusing all attempts to extract taxes and manpower. What's worse, with the mercenaries that helped bring us victory gone, they greatly outnumber us, far more so than the Helot slaves we were able to control back home.
