But we are completely outnumbered by the local barbarians. With the locals plotting our demise, and with our hold over the city not yet consolidated, we must act fast to stabilize our new kingdom, or we may have to flee back to Sparta faster than when we arrived.\n\n#E Will our city emerge from the shadow of Kleonymos' bloody conquest?#!"
 patauion_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We must stabilize #E Patauion#!, and either integrate the angry locals, or fully subjegate them as Helot slaves."

 patauion_mission_task_1_DESC: "We have fought hard, and journeyed far, to aquire this city. However, not all is well and good in the kingdom of Patauion. Our conquest of a proud people, the Patavi, means that our upper class must contend with a most unruly, and violent, population - However will we be able to forge our new realm a stable kingdom?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 patauion_mission_task_2_DESC: "While we lived in Sparta, many of our noble families lived in competition with one another, feuding, back-stabbing, and even ordering assasinations against one another. In this foreign land however, we seldom have time to worry about our old petty disputes, not while the Patavi that surround us conspire and sharpen their knives at us.\nIf we are to survive the coming years, the few Spartan nobles of Patauion must band together - we cannot afford to remain disunited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"
 patauion_mission_task_3_DESC: "With difficulty in collecting tax, we are severly lacking in recources and must find a way to remedy this. If we are to make contact with another, well off, Hellenic state, we might be able to convince them that it would be in their best interest to help one of their brethren during our initials struggles to form a stable polis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
 patauion_mission_task_4_DESC: "The local tribes in the region are numerous and varying in strength. And while their ways are barbarous, we cannot afford to make enemies right now. In fact, given our severe lack of recources, if we are to make a strong local alliance, maybe our new ally could be convinced to send us some support...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 patauion_mission_task_5_DESC: "Our city lies at a crossroads. Its future unsure, and lacking any foundations as of yet, we must see to it that we start directing it towards the realm that we wish to construct - With so many opposing ideas on what steps to take, we must decide quickly and act decisively, lest our kingdom fall prematurely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"
 patauion_mission_task_6_DESC: "They shout and scream at us in the streets, fearful of being subject to tyranny, the Patavi demand to either be given rights and privilages, or to see us thrown out. If we are to pacify the Locals, we should give in to at least a few of their demands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil30!"
 patauion_mission_task_7_DESC: "The local Patavi not only view us with contempt, but see us as far too foreign to be able to govern them. But what if we are to prove them wrong? If we are to construct platforms from where they are able to voice their dissatisfactions and necessities, free of persecution, they may be far more willing to cooperate with their Hellenic administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil5!"
 patauion_mission_task_8_DESC: "Since we've arrived in this city, we have made great strides to understand the locals, and to repair the damages made during or initial conquest. The locals who once saw us with contempt, now cooperate with us, and even greet us in the streets. But we are not yet truely a city of equals, and there still exists a great divide inbetween the Spartan noble class and the Venetic population of which we rule over - and if we are to secure a kingdom free of the social tensions that have plagued it for so long, we must do something about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil15!"
 patauion_mission_task_9_DESC: "While we now remain hopelessly outnumbered by the Patavi, recalling how we managed to sieze control of their city does bring a potential temporary solution, the employment of mercenaries. Aside from the use that they could bring to us by serving as body guards, they could also be used to extract those taxes that the Patavi have been denying us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil28!"
 patauion_mission_task_10_DESC: "The Patavi have resisted our rule for too long, heckeling us, scaring us with their threats of violence. Their actions would have never been permited in our old home of Sparta! Well now, it is time that we disciplined these Patavi barbarians, and put them in the shackles of the Helots that they rightfully deserve to wear - for their threats are surely empty, and their spirits surely weak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil21!"
 patauion_mission_task_11_DESC: "Through much bloodshed we have fought to secure this kingdom, and through much fighting we have shown that we are worthy. Come Ares! See that we are truely worthy of continuing our old warriors heritage! See the glory of the great Spartan kingdom of Patauion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"
 patauion_mission_task_12_DESC: "Horseback based social classes are no strange thing to the people of Hellas. They were of great importance to the rivals of our ancestors, the Athenians and Macedonians, however the native people of Venetia have a special affinity with horses, and have a most admirable martial tradition linked to their 'horselords'. - We would be fools not to recruit the Ekupetar elites into our Hippeis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 patauion_mission_task_13_DESC: "Coming to these Venetic shores, we did so with the guidance of our old Hellenic gods, however, in these lands, the wisdom of the local Patavi deities lights the way. While we mustn't abandon those who we have for so long reveared, we should reflect the significance of the gods of the Veneti - are Artemis and Reitia that different after all?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
 patauion_mission_task_14_DESC: "The Spartans are famous for their unbreakable spirit, seldom retreating in battle. Yet faced with a slave revolt, many of our upper class shuddered, and cowered in fear, especially the youngest of our men.\nIt is clear that, with our hands held back by instability and lack of resources, we have failed to uphold those ancient traditions of a truely Spartan martial education - this is a situation that we must rectify immediately!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
 patauion_mission_task_15_DESC: "It is by the grace of Ares that we were able to take this land, and it was the blessing of Ares that allowed us to overcome the great Helot revolt. Let us thank our great god, and build a great temple from which his splendor can shine across the whole of Italia!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil19!"
 patauion_mission_task_16_DESC: "While it would be ideal to find allies that could support us through our current situation, a lack of options means that we may have to diliberate how to support ourselves without any external assistance - while regretable, it may be our only option forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil28!"

While we set out for glory, we where unsure where our voyage across the Adriatic Sea would take us, upon seeing the riches of Patauion however, we desired to take them into our Laemacedonian hands. Now, with our victory won, Kleonymos has decided to use the opportunity to forge a new kingdom for us, with his comerades as his new Spartan nobility. But not all is well in our kingdom of Patauion.\n\nOutraged at being disenfranchised, the local Patavi look upon us with utter contempt, refusing all attempts to extract taxes and manpower. What's worse, with the mercenaries that helped bring us victory gone, they greatly outnumber us, far more so than the Helot slaves we were able to control back home.
