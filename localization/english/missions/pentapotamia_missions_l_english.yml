 pentapotamia_missions:0 "Reverse Okeanos"
 pentapotamia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "We are a conflicted bunch. The sons of #E Porus#! meet the sons of #E Alexander#!. The sons of the #E Indus#! meet the sons of the #E Aegean#!. We need to not only figure out our identity in the world, but how to honor both legacies we derive from. A whisper of an echo speaks to us and tells us of a new concept... #E Reverse Okeanos#!."
 pentapotamia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have completed #E Reverse Okeanos#!."
 pentapotamia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "May #E Alexander#! and #E Porus#! bless our legacy."
 
 #Missions
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_1:0 "Where Two Became One"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Our story is one of union between two people. We are not invaders, yet we are. We are not natives, yet we are. We exist as a compromise between two peoples and we must cement this idea if we are to rule properly."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_2:0 "Indian Influences"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "We must embrace our Indic ways if we are to convince our subjects that we are of their blood. Without it, surely they will find us just another invador of the land of the #E Sindhu River#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_3:0 "Hellenization Hopes"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "We must embrace our Hellenic ways if we are to honor our legacy that we are of #E Greek#! blood. Without it, to make moves on the #E Hellenistic#! powers of the world will surely result in backlash."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_4:0 "A True Yavanaraja"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The #E Greco-Indian#! Kingdom, or the #E Yavanaraja#!, was an entity that existed, lead by #E Greco-Bactrians#! who became #E Indo-Greeks#!. Our case is different. We were not invaders, nor were we natives. We are a mixture of both, making us a true #E Yavanaraja#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_5:0 "Blood of Porus"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "We were directly descended from him on our #E Indian#! side. His defense against the mightiest empire instills within us the will to persevere."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_6:0 "Blood of Alexander"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "While we are not directly related to the great conquerer, we are clearly born from his conquests. From him arose the idea of #E Greeks#! in India."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_7:0 "Proof of Conquest"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "To truly show that we are continuing the legacy of #E Porus#! and #E Alexander#!, we must prove that we can conquer the entirety of the #E Indus River Valley#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_8:0 "Reverse Okeanos"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "#E Alexander#! once had a dream. A dream that was stopped by #E Porus#!. That dream was #Y Okeanos#!. The dream to reach the other side of the world; to reach the ocean.\n\nNow we lay on the opposite side of the world. And so a new dream has been formed by our own ruler, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen|E]. And that dream is #Y Reverse Okeanos#!; the dream to reach the other side of the world.\n\n#R Reverse Okeanos should be achieved in 30 years or less, otherwise there will be consequences.#!"
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_9:0 "Alexandria Baktriane"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "Alexandria the Furthest, the upper limits of Alexander's conquest. It is out of the way for our direct conquest path, yet the ghost of Alexander calls to us still."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_10:0 "Alexandria Ariana"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Alexandria Ariana, the region just before reaching India, thus the region we must take first in order to initiate our quest."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_11:0 "Alexandria Parthike"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Alexandria Parthike, the region of the Caspian Sea. While it may seem like we have found #Y Okeanos#!, it is merely a façade, we have yet much more to come."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_12:0 "Fractured Farlands"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The furthest provinces from Alexander's homelands apart from #E India#! herself; #E Persis#!, #E Ariana#!, #E Parthia#!, #E Bactriana#!, and #E Media#!. They are fractured now, but they once belonged to Alexander, and they shall once more become part of his newest and furthest successor Kingdom."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_13:0 "Path Through Persia"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The march through #E Persia#! is one of the defining features of #E Alexander's#! conquests. Through #E Gedrosia#! we must march, and #E Persia#! then shall fall!"
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_14:0 "March on Media"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "A detour to the land of #E Medes#!, it is an important piece to #E Alexander's#! Empire, one of great history, culture, and repute."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_15:0 "Crescent of Conflict"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "The Fertile Crescent region holds four of the richest regions of the Empire. #E Canan#! and #E Syria#! in the levant, and #E Assyria#! and #E Mesopotamia#! east of that. The conquest of #E Babylon#! itself may be the crowning jewel of #E Alexander's#! conquests, and it shall once more be taken, this time by our hands."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_16:0 "Land Between the Rivers"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "#E Babylon#!, #E Uruk#!, #E Susa#!, #E Asshur#!, and more lay just east of #E Persis#!. This was the site of #E Alexander's#! ambition of a new identity for his empire, and we shall honor him by reconquering these areas in his name."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_17:0 "Unsatisfied Yet Still"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "#Y Reverse Okeanos#! has been achieved!... yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen|E] is not done yet. #E Alexander#! conquered #E Egypt#!, #E Anatolia#!, and of course #E Greece#! and #E Macedon#!. We need these territories to truly feel like #E Alexander#! once did."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_18:0 "Land Past the Rivers"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "The smell of seasalt grows ever stronger. With these conquests, we will have achieved #Y Okeanos#!. The anticipation cannot wait much longer, our goals are in eye's view."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_19:0 "Mountains of Armenia"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "The mountaneous region of #E Armenia#! is rugged, it reminds us almost of the #E Himalayas#! back home. It will be no easy feat to conquer it all, yet as #E Alexander#! did, we must do too."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_20:0 "Okeanos Achieved"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "Our ultimate goal has been achieved. The smell of the sea, so far yet so familiar. #E Alexander#! would be proud of his greatest successor's conquests. #Y Reverse Okeanos#! is done."

 pentapotamia_missions_task_21:0 "Alexandria Eschate"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "Alexandria the Furthest, the upper limits of Alexander's conquest. It is out of the way for our direct conquest path, yet the ghost of Alexander calls to us still."
