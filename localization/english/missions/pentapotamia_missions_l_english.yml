 pentapotamia_missions_task_1:0 "Where Two Became One"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Our story is one of union between two people. We are not invaders, yet we are. We are not natives, yet we are. We exist as a compromise between two peoples and we must cement this idea if we are to rule properly."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_2:0 "Indian Influences"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "We must embrace our Indic ways if we are to convince our subjects that we are of their blood. Without it, surely they will find us just another invador of the land of the #E Sindhu River#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_3:0 "Hellenization Hopes"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "We must embrace our Hellenic ways if we are to honor our legacy that we are of #E Greek#! blood. Without it, to make moves on the #E Hellenistic#! powers of the world will surely result in backlash."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_4:0 "A True Yavanaraja"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The #E Greco-Indian#! Kingdom, or the #E Yavanaraja#!, was an entity that existed, lead by #E Greco-Bactrians#! who became #E Indo-Greeks#!. Our case is different. We were not invaders, nor were we natives. We are a mixture of both, making us a true #E Yavanaraja#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_5:0 "Blood of Porus"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "We were directly descended from him on our #E Indian#! side. His defense against the mightiest empire instills within us the will to persevere."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_6:0 "Blood of Alexander"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "While we are not directly related to the great conquerer, we are clearly born from his conquests. From him arose the idea of #E Greeks#! in India."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_7:0 "Proof of Conquest"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "To truly show that we are continuing the legacy of #E Porus#! and #E Alexander#!, we must prove that we can conquer the entirety of the #E Indus River Valley#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_8:0 "Reverse Okeanos"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "#E Alexander#! once had a dream. A dream that was stopped by #E Porus#!. That dream was #Y Okeanos#!. The dream to reach the other side of the world; to reach the ocean.\n\nNow we lay on the opposite side of the world. And so a new dream has been formed by our own ruler, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen|E]. And that dream is #Y Reverse Okeanos#!; the dream to reach the other side of the world.\n\n#R Reverse Okeanos should be achieved in 30 years or less, otherwise there will be consequences.#!"

 pentapotamia_missions_task_14:0 "March on Media"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "A detour to the land of #E Medes#!, it is an important piece to #E Alexander's#! Empire, one of great history, culture, and repute."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_15:0 "Crescent of Conflict"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "The Fertile Crescent region holds four of the richest regions of the Empire. #E Canaan#! and #E Syria#! in the levant, and #E Assyria#! and #E Mesopotamia#! east of that. The conquest of #E Babylon#! itself may be the crowning jewel of #E Alexander's#! conquests, and it shall once more be taken, this time by our hands."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_16:0 "Land Between the Rivers"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "#E Babylon#!, #E Uruk#!, #E Susa#!, #E Asshur#!, and more lay just east of #E Persis#!. This was the site of #E Alexander's#! ambition of a new identity for his empire, and we shall honor him by reconquering these areas in his name."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_17:0 "Unsatisfied Yet Still"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "#Y Reverse Okeanos#! has been achieved!... yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen|E] is not done yet. #E Alexander#! conquered #E Egypt#!, #E Anatolia#!, and of course #E Greece#! and #E Macedon#!. We need these territories to truly feel like #E Alexander#! once did."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_18:0 "Okeanos Achieved"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Our ultimate goal has been achieved. The smell of the sea, so far yet so familiar. #E Alexander#! would be proud of his greatest successor's conquests. #Y Reverse Okeanos#! is done.\n\n#G We will no longer face collapse#!."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_19:0 "Mountains of Armenia"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "The mountainous region of #E Armenia#! is rugged, it reminds us almost of the #E Himalayas#! back home. It will be no easy feat to conquer it all, yet as #E Alexander#! did, we must do too."
 
 pentapotamia_missions_task_20:0 "Lands of the Levant"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "The land of the Syrians, Philistines, and Phoenecians; and many more frankly. An important part of the empire surely, if only to connect us to the Okeanosian world further."

 pentapotamia_missions_task_21:0 "Alexandria Eschate"
 pentapotamia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "Alexandria the Furthest, the upper limits of Alexander's conquest. It is out of the way for our direct conquest path, yet the ghost of Alexander calls to us still."
