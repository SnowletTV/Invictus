 phoenicia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "From the island fortress of Arados to the bustling harbors of Sidon and Tyre, the Phoenician were renowned as traders, shipwrights, and explorers of unparalleled quality. It was we who taught the world the secrets of the sea, who built mighty Carthage, and who connected distant lands through networks of commerce and culture. But the era of subservience to empires and overlords must end. The waves that have borne our ships to every corner of the known world will now carry us toward dominance, both on land and at sea. The time has come to unite the cities of Phoenicia and reclaim the glory that is our birthright."

Such a ship will always have an extremely limited maneuverability in a pitched naval battle. For siege warfare however these 'Mega Polyremes' are ideal as they are able to break open seaside walls and then act as platforms for artillery while also allowing great number of troops to land.

According to legend, the island takes its name from Thasos, a son of King Phoenix, who traveled to the island in search of Europa. By the 7th century BC, Greek colonists from Paros arrived. Thasian wine was celebrated throughout the ancient world for its exceptional quality. Grapevines and the wine-god Dionysos were prominently featured on Thasian coinage. Alongside wine, Thasos also gained fame for its nuts, marble, and as a hub of maritime trade. The Thasian colonies: Skapte Hyle, Neapolis, Galepsos, Oisyme, Apollonia, Antisara, Akontisma, Pistiros, and Stryme extended its influence to the mainland, including control of even richer gold mines there, with revenues once estimated between 200 and 300 talents annually. These resources made Thasos a target for greater powers such as Persia, Athens, and Sparta, as the island played an important part in the Ionian Revolt, the Delian League, and the Peloponnesian Wars. Athenian domination of the island passed under loose Macedonian control after Philip of Macedon's victory at Chaeronea in 338 BC.\n\nThe island's gold mines, now lie derelict, their wealth buried and forgotten.

 phoenicia_missions_task_38_DESC:0 "ripoli, known in Greek as 'Tripolis' and in Phoenician as 'Atri', was likely the youngest of the five major Phoenician cities. While Eusebius of Caesarea dates its foundation to 761 BC, Diodorus places its origins in the Persian period. Archaeological evidence suggests that the site was inhabited as early as the 14th century BC. Rising sea levels have submerged much of the Persian-era layers, complicating archeological work. The city derived its Greek name, 'Tripolis', meaning 'Three Cities,' from its tripartite structure. According to classical sources, Tripoli was founded by the Phoenician cities of Arados, Sidon, and Tyre, each establishing a distinct town approximately 200 meters apart. These towns, individually fortified and likely governed by their respective mother cities, formed a confederation that shared a harbor. During the Persian period, Tripoli was the seat of a pan-Phoenician council. Diodorus notes that 'Tripoli occupied the highest rank of all the cities of Phoenicia' because the city hosted general assemblies where kings and representatives from various Phoenician cities deliberated on matters of collective importance. After the defeat of the Persians at the battle of Issus, Darius III's mercenaries, led by the traitor Amyntas seized Tripoli. Amyntas used it as a base to launch an ill fated attempt to seize Egypt for himself. After its three founding cities, Arados, Sidon, and Tyre, submitted to Alexander, Tripoli did likewise."

 phoenicia_missions_task_41_DESC:0 "Tyre was founded in the early 3rd millennium BC. The rivalry between Tyre and Sidon defined much of Phoenicia's political history, with both cities grappling for control of trade networks and influence over the smaller Phoenician settlements. The city consisted of a fortified island stronghold and its mainland counterpart, Ushu, which provided agricultural resources and timber from nearby forests. Tyre's economic strength was bolstered by its production of Tyrian purple dye, a highly sought-after luxury good, and its extensive colonization efforts. Among its most notable colonies were Carthage, Kition, and Gadir. The city submitted to Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian rulers, often leveraging its vast resouces to preserve its autonomy. When [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetName] arived in #E Ushu#!, the mainland city opposite the island of Tyre, King [GetCharacter('(int32)543').GetPraenomen], was serving in the Persian fleet alongside #E Autophradates#! and #E Pharnabazus III#!, the satraps Lydia and Hellespontine Phrygia respectively. In his absence, a delegation of Tyrian nobles greeted Alexander. Though they offered symbolic submission, they rejected his request to sacrifice at the temple of Melqart on the island. This refusal enraged [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen] and thus began one of the most grueling sieges in history. After seven months, [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen]'s forces breached Tyre's walls with a combination of relentless siegecraft and naval power. His troops stormed the city, slaughtering and enslaving thousands of its defenders. [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen] spared King [GetCharacter('(int32)543').GetPraenomen], who had not participated in the refusal to surrender, and left him on the throne.

Laborers would create 'Tyrian purple' by periodically jabbing the murex with a rod, prompting them to secrete a film which would then be collected in vats. Its estimated that it would take the combined secretions produced by twelve thousand snails to dye the lining of an article of clothing. Dying an entire toga was would take a quarter of a million snails. For this reason, only the very wealthiest could afford it, and the color purple became associated with royalty. The process of producing purple was a trade secret at this time, potentially explaining the origin of Phoenicia's name (land of purple). The most common shade of purple was called Tyrian Purple, named after Tyre, the foremost Phoenician city. Vast piles of discarded shells bear testament to centuries of production for export of this coveted royal color. The process is labor-intensive, requiring thousands of snails for even a small quantity of dye. Once harvested, the glands are crushed and fermented, with the resulting pigment exposed to sunlight to achieve its brilliant, long-lasting purple hue."

Archaeological evidence suggests that the site was inhabited as early as the 14th century BC. Rising sea levels have submerged much of the Persian-era layers, complicating archeological work. The city derived its Greek name, 'Tripolis', meaning 'Three Cities,' from its tripartite structure. According to classical sources, Tripoli was founded by the Phoenician cities of Arados, Sidon, and Tyre, each establishing a distinct town approximately 200 meters apart. These towns, individually fortified and likely governed by their respective mother cities, formed a confederation that shared a harbor. During the Persian period, Tripoli was the seat of a pan-Phoenician council. Diodorus notes that 'Tripoli occupied the highest rank of all the cities of Phoenicia' because the city hosted general assemblies where kings and representatives from various Phoenician cities deliberated on matters of collective importance. After the defeat of the Persians at the battle of Issus, Darius III's mercenaries, led by the traitor Amyntas seized Tripoli. Amyntas used it as a base to launch an ill fated attempt to seize Egypt for himself. After its three founding cities, Arados, Sidon, and Tyre, submitted to Alexander, Tripoli did likewise.\n\nOur overtures to Tripoli have been successful.

The rivalry between Tyre and Sidon defined much of Phoenicia's political history, with both cities grappling for control of trade networks and influence over the smaller Phoenician settlements. The city consisted of a fortified island stronghold and its mainland counterpart, Ushu, which provided agricultural resources and timber from nearby forests. Tyre's economic strength was bolstered by its production of Tyrian purple dye, a highly sought-after luxury good, and its extensive colonization efforts. Among its most notable colonies were Carthage, Kition, and Gadir. The city submitted to Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian rulers, often leveraging its vast resouces to preserve its autonomy. When [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetName] arived in #E Ushu#!, the mainland city opposite the island of Tyre, King [GetCharacter('(int32)543').GetPraenomen], was serving in the Persian fleet alongside #E Autophradates#! and #E Pharnabazus III#!, the satraps Lydia and Hellespontine Phrygia respectively. In his absence, a delegation of Tyrian nobles greeted Alexander. Though they offered symbolic submission, they rejected his request to sacrifice at the temple of Melqart on the island. Instead, they suggested he make his offering at the mainland temple. This refusal enraged [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen], who declared, 'Your position gives you assurance, and, because you live on an island, you despise my army of infantrymen. However, I want you to know that you will let me enter your city, willingly or by force!' Thus began one of the most grueling sieges in history. Determined to take Tyre, [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen] ordered the construction of a massive causeway to connect the mainland to the island, using stones from the ruins of Ushu. The Tyrians fiercely resisted, launching fire ships against the Macedonian siege towers and using their fleet to harass the construction. Despite their efforts, the causeway advanced, supported by [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen]'s engineers and a growing fleet that included Phoenician and Cypriot ships that had defected from the Persian navy. After seven months, [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen]'s forces breached Tyre's walls with a combination of relentless siegecraft and naval power.

Its estimated that it would take the combined secretions produced by twelve thousand snails to dye the lining of an article of clothing. Dying an entire toga was would take a quarter of a million snails. For this reason, only the very wealthiest could afford it, and the color purple became associated with royalty. The process of producing purple was a trade secret at this time, potentially explaining the origin of Phoenicia's name (land of purple). The most common shade of purple was called Tyrian Purple, named after Tyre, the foremost Phoenician city. Vast piles of discarded shells bear testament to centuries of production for export of this coveted royal color.
