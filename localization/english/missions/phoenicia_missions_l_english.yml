 phoenicia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "For centuries, Phoenician shipwrights have consturced the greatest fleets in the world, but our hard work has been in the service of greater powers: Cambyses comissioned our people to construct the first imperial navy in history to conquer Egypt, the Achaemenid royal fleet was the first imperial navy in history. Although Phoenician shipwrights toiled; Alexander sailed our ships to the ends of the earth; now it appears, his sucessors, these Diadochi intend to exploit us as their predecesors did...\nThe time has come for a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] royal fleet to be constructed, not for our overlords, but for ourselves."

 phoenicia_missions_task_2:0 "Maritime Training"

 phoenicia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Ships with ten rowers or more per side were first employed by Alexander the Great but became even more commonplace after the Antigonid navies used them in the siege of Tyre and beyond.  Such a ship will always have an extremely limited maneuverability in a pitched naval battle. For siege warfare however these 'Mega Polyremes' are ideal as they are able to break open seaside walls and then act as platforms for artillery while also allowing great number of troops to land. It is only right that we construct such vessels for ourselves, for what royal navy is complete without a mighty flagship?"

This coalition held sway over the southern Levantine coast. Their cities, much like #E Phoenicia's#!, became vital hubs of commerce and seafaring in the Mediterranean. Despite their shared Canaanite origin, the Philistines developed distinct customs from their Phoenician bretheren but shared in the rich maritime and mercantile traditions that made this region prosperous.\n\nThe Pentapolis thrived for centuries, but its fortunes shifted with the tides of conquest. #E King Nebuchadnezzar II#! of #E Babylon#! would eventually bring the Pentapolis to its knees during his campaigns in the twilight of the 7th century BC. He devastated the cities, scattering their people and breaking the power of this once-great league."

 ###For centuries, Cilician pirates have sailed all over the Eastern Mediterranean, spreading havoc on coastal cities, preying on traders and alimenting the slave market. As long as we are victim of their raids, our traders will be unable to safely traverse the Levantine Sea. Perhaps a bribe would do us some good?
