 cde_me_pon_01.20.t: "The Many Tribes of Colchis"
 cde_me_pon_01.20.desc: "The region of Colchis is an extremely diverse melting pot of different language, cultures and traditions; the city of Dioskourias alone has hundreds of languages that are spoken amongst its inhabitants. Thus, it is quite the impressive feat that we have - temporarily - appeased the many tribes and peoples of Colchis."
 cde_me_pon_01.20.a: "Let us strive to keep these peoples loyal"
 cde_me_pon_01.21.t: "A Client King in Colchis"
 cde_me_pon_01.21.desc: "Though we have decided that Colchis would be better off under indirect rule through a client king, we have not yet decided on who exactly should inherit the responsibility of ruling the lands of Colchis. After some deliberation, three individuals have been identified: a member of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s direct family, a distance cousin of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and a prominent local Colchian ruler."

 cde_me_pon_01.22.desc: "Now that we have established a naval base in Trapezous, we now have the means to protect the Greeks across the sea. The Greeks in Taurica have been all but defeated by the Royal Scythians, with Chersonesus as well as the cities of the Bosporan Kingdom being the only former Greek colonies that have not fallen to Scythian rule. Thus, let us stake claims to Taurica so we may cross the seas as sincere defenders of Greek autonomy!"
 cde_me_pon_01.22.a: "Protect the Greeks of Taurica!"
 cde_me_pon_01.23.t: "Pontic Protectors of Taurica"

 cde_me_pon_01.24.t: "Friends in Chersonesos"
 cde_me_pon_01.24.desc: "With the city of Chersonesos secured under Pontic influence, it is time that we look elsewhere for expanding our influence across the Black Sea coast. Our Chersonese friends tell us of the rich emporia of Olbia and Tyras, once influential Greek cities that have now fallen under the influence of the barbarian tribes of the Scythians and Sarmatians to the north. Thus, as protectors of the Euxine Greeks, let us liberate those cities as well."
 cde_me_pon_01.25.t: "Secure Trade in the Northwest Emporia"
 cde_me_pon_01.25.desc: "We have liberated the trade cities of Olbia and Tyras from their barbarian overlords, driving back the Scythians and Sarmatians so they may no longer raid the cities and strike fear into the hearts of the vulnerable Greeks along the coast."
 cde_me_pon_01.25.a: "No Greeks shall know fear under our banner"
 cde_me_pon_01.26.t: "Neapolis Taurike"
 cde_me_pon_01.26.desc: "We have seized the prestigious Scythian city of Neapolis Taurike. Home to both Scythian and Greek peoples, the Scythians have admittedly developed the town into a bustling center of Taurica, with Greek traders, architects and artisans contributing to the culture and wealth of the city. Thus, we have invested our own funds to expand the city of Neapolis Taurike as a strategic, economic and cultural center of Pontus in Taurica."
 cde_me_pon_01.26.a: "Let us continue to develop Taurica"
 cde_me_pon_01.27.t: "Bosporan Subjugation"
 cde_me_pon_01.27.desc: "The subjugation of the Bosporan Greeks has granted us greater military and economic opportunities. Thus, let us take advantage of our new territories by establishing Pontic merchants in the central city of Theodosia."
 cde_me_pon_01.27.a: "Splendid."
 cde_me_pon_01.28.t: "Bosporan Integration"
 cde_me_pon_01.28.desc: "We have proven our dedication to the Bosporan Greeks by developing their lands and ensuring that they thrive under Pontic rule. Thus, even those in the Bosporan cities who were skeptical of our intentions in their homeland have been swayed by our generosity and benevolence."
 cde_me_pon_01.28.a: "All Greeks, whether Pontic or Bosporan, shall thrive"
 cde_me_pon_01.29.t: "Scythian Noble Tribes Rebel"
 cde_me_pon_01.29.desc: "The Scythian nobles who fear losing influence in the Bosporan region now that we are in charge have been purposefully incited into revolt. This roots out those who are disatisfied with our rule, leaving only loyal Scythians, or at least those that are indifferent, as subjects of our kingdom. Thus, let us crush these Scythian rebels and show all of the tribes that we are not to be defied!"
 cde_me_pon_01.29.a: "Let us crush this pathetic resistance!"
 cde_me_pon_01.30.t: "Champion of Euxine Greeks"
 cde_me_pon_01.30.desc: "We have liberated all of the Greeks along the northern and eastern Black Sea, and all Greeks along the coast know of the name of our great basileus. Thus, we have officially declared our ruler the savior of the Black Sea Greeks.\n\nHaving ushered in a brand new era for Greeks in the Black Sea, it may be fitting for our ruler to adopt a fitting title or epithet to commemorate their achievements."
 cde_me_pon_01.30.a: "'Soter,' meaning 'the Savior'"
