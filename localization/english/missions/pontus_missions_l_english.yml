Yet the fate of our dynasty flutters in the wind as so-called friends covet our holdings, while the Wars of the Diadochi grind lesser realms beneath Macedonian boots.\n\nWe must be bold. If danger closes round our Pergamese lands, we ought to abandon them, only for a season, and look east to the sheltering heights of Paphlagonia and Pontic Cappadocia.

To commemorate this victory, a grand temple was constructed from white marble in the Corinthian style, and an annual festival called the Sacaea was established in its honor. This festival, as described by Strabo, bore striking similarities to Bacchic rituals, where men, adorned in Scythian garb, would engage in revelry, drinking, and merrymaking with women throughout the day and night. The governance of Zela closely resembled that of Comana Pontica, with its theocratic structure centered around a powerful priesthood. As was commonplace in Anatolia, priests of the temple exercised control over the whole surrounding area, which was populated by numerous temple-servants and priests. The temple was not only a place of celebration but also a center for religious activity tied to both the Zoroastrian and Anatolian pantheons. Local mythology revered the goddess Artemis Anaitis and the god Men as a a mother-son duo, fusing Persian and Anatolian traditions."

One of the most important temples in the region was housed here and was dedicated to the goddess of Ma. The cult of Ma then carried onwards to Comana Cappadocia. Eventually, Sulla, who claimed that in a dream, Ma gave him lightning to destroy his enemies would introduce her cult to Rome. The citizens of Comana Pontica acquired great wealth from the vineyards and from the merchants and their customers who came to the city during the grand festival which took place twice a year. Strabo remarks that its multitude of prostitutes dedicated to the goddess Ma made it in a way a 'lesser Corinth.' 6000 sacred slaves known as hierodouloi worked the fields of the temple territory and were dedicated to the service of Ma. They had an enviable position, being granted inviolability. The temple state of Comana Pontica's territory would be considerably expanded once it came under Roman rule."

While what they talked about is unknown, doubtless overtures were made to secure his allegiance. With the threat of rebellion from [GetCharacter('(int32)52').GetPraenomen] looming, [GetCountry('PRY').GetRuler.GetPraenomen] has concocted a diplomatic masterstroke. A message will be sent to [GetCharacter('(int32)52').GetPraenomen], naming him as Satrap of #E Hellespontine Phrygia#!, a title tied to the seat of Daskyleion. This province, once governed by his relative, the great Artabazos, has not had a satrap in 15 years, ever since Antigonos seized it for himself. Though the title would do little to change [GetCharacter('(int32)52').GetName]'s actual position, it would confer much-needed legitimacy to the Mithridatid dynasty and provide political unity to their holdings in Mysia and Mariandynia. Of course, it will be predicated on him giving us the honor of hosting his nephew, [GetCharacter('(int32)228').GetName], at the Antigonid court.\n\nAfter Euemene's death, [GetCharacter('(int32)228').GetName], having distinguished himself on the battlefield, gained the favor [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] and became close friends with [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen]'s son [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen].\n\nHowever, [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] soon became suspicious of #E Ktistes#!. According to legend, [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] dreamed that he was walking across a large and beautiful field and sowing it with gold dust, but Mithridates reaped the harvest and took it away to the region of the coastal Black Sea. [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] decided to kill him and told [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen] about his plans but swore him to silence. But [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen] would not allow his friend to have such a fate. During the siege of Tyre, the two went for a walk alone on the seashore, and [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetPraenomen] used his spear to write 'Flee, Mithridates' in the sand, thereby keeping the vow of silence given to his father. Mithridates understood and immediately left the court of [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] at night with a handful of companions. While his exact whereabouts are unknown, its rumored that #E Ktistes#! is in a Mariandynian residence of his uncle's, along the border with #E Paphlagonia#!.\n\nFramed as a gesture of alliance and goodwill, the proposal states that [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetPraenomen] is willing to let bygones be bygones and [GetCharacter('(int32)228').GetName] will be treated as an honored guest. With his heir as a veritable hostage, [GetCharacter('(int32)52').GetPraenomen]'s latitude to maneuver will diminish considerably."
