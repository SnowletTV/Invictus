 ## EVENTS ##
 
 punic_resurgence_1_title:0 "Protectors of Africa"
 punic_resurgence_1_desc:0 "The Carthaginians have seen fit to grant our request. We will defend the shores of Africa, leaving them free to continue campaigns in Iberia and other regions with the confidence that their heartland will be safe in our capable hands. In exchange, they have agreed to supply our fleets and aid us in any way they can, as well as granting us a few minor ports to use as supply bases. They have, however, warned us that should we fail to defend the shores of Africa these exclusive rights will be stripped away and we will be forced back to our old station as merely one among many Punic states of the Western Mediterranean."
 punic_resurgence_1.a:0 "Their confidence is placed wisely."
 
 punic_resurgence_2_title:0 "Messenger from Carthago"
 punic_resurgence_2_desc:0 "Our messenger has returned from Carthage empty-handed. They were laughed out of the Senate halls for being far too bold in their request. We will not be granted any more favors, says the government, and we should be grateful for what we already have."
 punic_resurgence_2.a:0 "They will regret this!"
 
 punic_resurgence_3_title:0 "Messenger from [mission_country.GetName]"
 punic_resurgence_3_desc:0 "The Senate has received a messenger from our subject city in [mission_country.GetName]. They have an intriguing proposal for us: in exchange for a few ports around Africa and further diplomatic favor, they will dedicate their fleet to protecting our shores for us while our forces are away on campaign. \n \n Some advisors believe this will free us up for campaigns further from our home shores, while others see this as yet another power play by a desperate local government."
 punic_resurgence_3.a:0 "We will grant their request, so long as they hold up their end of the bargain."
 punic_resurgence_3.b:0 "Is that not what a loyal subject should do anyway?"
 
 punic_resurgence_4_title:0 "An Alliance of Subjects"
 punic_resurgence_4_desc:0 "Our Punic subjects have banded together to create a so-called Punic League. They say it is for economic and diplomatic reasons, but it is becoming increasingly clear that they do not wish to continue as our subjects. We may want to watch out for schemes or betrayal in the future."
 punic_resurgence_4.a:0 "After all we've done for them..."
 
 punic_resurgence_5_title:0 "Proposal from [mission_country.GetName]"
 punic_resurgence_5_desc:0 "Our government has received an interesting proposal from our sister city in [mission_country.GetName]. They are looking to form a league of Punic cities, ostensibly to promote trade and the economy of all members, but it seems clear that the underlying purpose is to eventually oppose the Carthaginian hegemony. \n \n If we join we would gain valuable allies, but at the cost of any goodwill Carthage has towards us. It is always risky to oppose such a major power."
 punic_resurgence_5.a:0 "We accept!"
 punic_resurgence_5.b:0 "We cannot... the risk is too great."
 
 punic_resurgence_6_title:0 "An Envoy from the Phoenicians"
 punic_resurgence_6_desc:0 "A diplomatic procession arrived in our capital today, coming from the Phoenician city of [mission_country.GetName]. They say that they wish to seek closer relations with us, seeing as we're both subject to Carthago. They were very insistent on that point, for some reason."
 punic_resurgence_6.a:0 "Ah! Friends! Join us for a feast!"
 punic_resurgence_6.b:0 "Turn them away."
 
 punic_resurgence_7_title:0 "An Envoy A Sister City"
 punic_resurgence_7_desc:0 "A diplomatic procession arrived in our capital today, coming from the Punic city of [mission_country.GetName]. They say that they wish to seek closer relations with us, seeing as we're both subject to Carthago. They were very insistent on that point, for some reason. As our sister city, we naturally have fairly good relations, but they indicated that they wanted to eventually form some sort of alliance."
 punic_resurgence_7.a:0 "Ah! Friends! Join us in council!"
 punic_resurgence_7.b:0 "Turn them away."
 
 punic_resurgence_8_title:0 "Treachery!"
 punic_resurgence_8_desc:0 "Many of our Punic subjects have together declared war upon us in the name of the so-called 'Punic League'. They say they wish to be free of us, and have banded together to achieve this. Clearly, even after all we've done, these treacherous subjects must be dealt with once and for all."
 punic_resurgence_8.a:0 "Marshal our armies. Destroy them!"
 
 punic_resurgence_9_title:0 "For Freedom!"
 punic_resurgence_9_desc:0 "[mission_country.GetName] has decided the time is right to strike. They introduced a motion to the Punic Council to declare war simultaneously upon our oppressor, Carthage, with the goal of bringing freedom to all of us."
 punic_resurgence_9.a:0 "We will go forth to victory!"
 
 punic_resurgence_10_title:0 "A Trade Dispute"
 punic_resurgence_10_desc:0 "Two members of the Punic League, [problem_one.GetName] and [problem_two.GetName] have come before us seeking resolution in a dispute. [problem_one.GetName] alleges that [problem_two.GetName] are holding some of their merchants in prison unlawfully, while [problem_two.GetName] says that the merchants were selling goods illegally to their citizens. They have been unable to reach a solution themselves, so they bring this case to the Punic Council. Both seem very riled up and angry, so we must tread cautiously."
 punic_resurgence_10.b:0 "[problem_one.GetName]'s merchants should be freed."
 punic_resurgence_10.a:0 "I think [problem_two.GetName] is in the right here; but the merchants must stand trial."
 
 punic_resurgence_11_title:0 "Usage of Taxes"
 punic_resurgence_11_desc:0 "Our allies in the Punic League, happy with our leadership, have donated some sums of money. Each is small, but together they are non-trivial. How should we use this money? Two of the League cities have applied for use of the funds."
 punic_resurgence_11.a:0 "[problem_one.GetName] needs them more."
 punic_resurgence_11.b:0 "It is critical that we support [problem_two.GetName]."
 punic_resurgence_11.c:0 "I'm the leader... the taxes belong to me!"
 
 punic_resurgence_12_title: "Infighting Amongst Allies"
 punic_resurgence_12_desc: "Although disagreements between partners is a common enough story, we have heard stories of some of the arguments between our League members becoming a bit too pointed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. It seems that camps are starting to coalesce around a couple of charismatic figures, who are taking the opportunity to give grand orations that denounce each other.\n\nAll of this, as you can imagine, is a distraction to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] business."
 punic_resurgence_12.a: "Pay close attention to the troublemakers"
 punic_resurgence_12.b: "We do not care about this matter at all"
 punic_resurgence_13_title: "State Leaves League"
 punic_resurgence_13_desc: "We have received messengers in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that bring a bit of unfortunate news - our Punic League has lost a member, for whatever ridiculous reason they are citing."
 punic_resurgence_13.a: "We don't need them anyways, but this is annoying nevertheless"
 
 punic_resurgence_14_title:0 "Response from [accepted.GetName]"
 punic_resurgence_14_desc:0 "[accepted.GetName] has joined us in our pan-Punic alliance. We are stronger together!"
 punic_resurgence_14.a:0 "Together, to victory!"
 
 punic_resurgence_15_title:0 "Alliance Shrinks"
 punic_resurgence_15_desc:0 "[leaving.GetName] has left us in our pan-Punic alliance. They cite troubles with our treatment of them and favoritism of the other cities."
 punic_resurgence_15.a:0 "Truly a dark day for Punic peoples."
 
 punic_resurgence_16_title: "An Enemy Force Has Landed!"
 punic_resurgence_16_desc: "Grim news, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - the reports are incomplete, no doubt due to the haste required to inform us, but it seems that an enemy force of indeterminate size has landed on our shores.\n\nBest keep this news from the men, as their morale is suffering as it is."
 punic_resurgence_16.a: "We shall meet their forces in battle and push them back into the sea!"
 
 punic_resurgence_17_title:0 "Protectors No Longer"
 punic_resurgence_17_desc:0 "The Carthaginian Senate, in light of repeated landings by enemy armies on the shores of Carthage itself, as well as elsewhere in Africa, have declared our status as Protectors of Africa to be revoked permanently."
 punic_resurgence_17.a:0 "They will regret this."
 
 punic_resurgence_18_title:0 "Carthage Requests Naval Aid"
 punic_resurgence_18_desc:0 "The Senate in Carthage, seeing the ongoing war, has requested that we provide them with additional ships to help in the war effort"
 punic_resurgence_18.a:0 "They will have what they are owed."
 punic_resurgence_18.b:0 "We... uh... have no ships for you."
 
 punic_resurgence_19_title:0 "Rise of [mission_country.GetName]"
 punic_resurgence_19_desc:0 "Our loyal subjects in [mission_country.GetName] are requesting their (official) independence. They have served us well, and may continue to do so into the future as our allies. How should we respond?"
 punic_resurgence_19.a:0 "They may go, so long as we remain allies."
 punic_resurgence_19.b:0 "How dare they! Always pushing for more."
