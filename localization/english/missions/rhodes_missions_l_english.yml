 #First Missions
 rhodes_01_aegean:0 "The Island of Roses"
 rhodes_01_aegean_DESCRIPTION:0 "As the power of Rhodes continues to grow at home, the time has come for us to spread our influence beyond our own shores."
 rhodes_01_aegean_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have asserted Rhodian rule over a majority of the Aegean."
 rhodes_01_aegean_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "The Aegean will be ours!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_1:0 "The Siegeworks of Demetrius"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_1_DESC:0 "Many expensive siegeworks have been left behind on the island by Demetrios during the Siege of Rhodes. Breaking down the siegeworks to sell, or perhaps even integrating them into our army, would prove useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_2:0 "Rebuilding the Island"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_2_DESC:0 "The siege of Rhodes has left the island in a very poor state. Much time must be taken to restore Rhodes to its former glory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_3:0 "Restoration of Rhodes"

 rhodes_01_aegean_task_4:0 "A City Reborn"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_4_DESC:0 "The prestige of Rhodes will be known far and wide once our great capital has been developed into one of the most prosperous cities on the Aegean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_por1!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_6:0 "Cretan Ambition"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_6_DESC:0 "Establishing a foothold in Crete will allow for rapid Rhodian expansion into the rich lands of the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_7:0 "Food Stores of the Sporades"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_7_DESC:0 "The Sporades islands often suffer from prolonged food shortages. Focusing on the production of food in this area would prove fruitful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_8:0 "Prepare an Invasion Force"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_8_DESC:0 "Having survived the siege of Rhodes, our people are now stronger than ever. However, during the siege a majority of our navy was destroyed by the Antigonids. We must prepare and invasion fleet so we can expand Rhodian influence in the Aegean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_9:0 "The Sporades"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_9_DESC:0 "The many islands of the Sporades lie close in proximity to Rhodes, but are farther out of reach than they appear due to Macedonian influence. With our newfound prestige, many believe that it would be viable to push for the consolidation of our homeland by bringing the Sporades under Rhodian control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_10:0 "Masters of Crete"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_10_DESC:0 "Conquering the island of Crete in its entirety has proved a worthwhile venture. With Crete under Rhodian control, we have become a well-respected Aegean power whose name is spoken far and wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil6!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_11:0 "A Cretan Metropolis"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_11_DESC:0 "There are many disparate cities on the island of Crete. Consolidating the people of Crete into one great metropolis would serve to strengthen Rhodian interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_12:0 "Developing Crete"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_12_DESC:0 "Now that Crete is firmly under Rhodian control, we must develop the island to expand the influence of Rhodes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_13:0 "Consolidating our Homeland"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_13_DESC:0 "Bringing all of the Sporades under our influence would ensure the saftey of Rhodes from any immediate threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_14:0 "The Aegean Islands"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_14_DESC:0 "The many disparate islands in the Aegean have been the center of trade in the Greek world for many centuries. Bringing these islands under our control will greatly aid our efforts to control trade in the Aegean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_15:0 "An Aegean Power"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_15_DESC:0 "Not long ago, the Rhodian people found themselves on the brink of destruction. Now, Rhodes has risen to be one of the strongest Greek powers in the world by controlling the lucrative territories of the Aegean sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_16:0 "The Matter of Lindos"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_16_DESC:0 "Lindos has long been a very prosperous part of Rhodes, second only to the city itself. However, the siege of Demetrios has left the territory in awful condition; restoring it to its former glory would be wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_17:0 "A Merchant Fleet"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_17_DESC:0 "The many merchants in the realm are calling from greater protection of important Rhodian trade routes by the navy. Protecting the commercial interests of Rhodes will serve to strengthen our already mighty economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_18:0 "A Military Fleet"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_18_DESC:0 "Military men all over the land are calling for a much stronger fleet. Many say that a strong fleet will deter any possible invaders and aid in any Rhodian expansion...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"
 
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_19:0 "The Cretan People"
 rhodes_01_aegean_task_19_DESC:0 "Integrating the people of Crete would serve to strengthen Rhodian rule over the island, and greatly expand our armies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

 #Events
 me_rhodes_1_title:0 "Egyptian Ties"
 me_rhodes_1_desc:0 "Our commercial ties with [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] was what led the Antigonid Kingdom to lay siege to our homeland. During the siege of Rhodes [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] even sent a small garrison of 500 men into Rhodes through the harbor to reinforce our troops. Our relationship with Egypt is very close but these are only informal ties. It has been proposed that we prepare an offer to send to [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] requesting that we formally ally ourselves."
 me_rhodes.1.a:0 "Send an alliance offer"
 me_rhodes.1.b:0 "Send gifts with the offer"
 me_rhodes.1.c:0 "Rhodes will remain neutral"
 
 me_rhodes_2_title:0 "Rhodes: An Alliance Offer"
 me_rhodes_2_desc:0 "The island of Rhodes has recently repelled a massive invasion from the Antigonids led by [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetName]. Our close commercial ties with Rhodes were the initial cause of the invasion. It is almost certain that if we do not seek to protect Rhodes, they will eventually be absorbed into the Antigonid realm. A diplomat from Rhodes has approached us with an offer for an alliance; how shall the we respond?"
 me_rhodes.2.a:0 "Accept their alliance offer"
 me_rhodes.2.b:0 "Offer them to become our tributary"
 me_rhodes.2.c:0 "Egypt wants nothing to do with Rhodes!"
 
 me_rhodes_3_title:0 "Egyptian Response"
 me_rhodes_3_desc_1:0 "Egypt has foolishly declined our offer for an alliance, leaving us to defend the island of Rhodes alone. Rhodes will prosper without their help."
 me_rhodes_3_desc_2:0 "Egypt has accepted our alliance offer! Now, with our position secured by the power of the Ptolemies, Rhodes stands as one of the most prestigious Aegean powers!"
 me_rhodes.3.a:0 "Oh well"
 me_rhodes.3.b:0 "This is great news!"
 
 me_rhodes_4_title:0 "Siegeworks of Demetrios"
 me_rhodes_4_desc:0 "That fool Demetrios went through extravagant lengths to subdue our city, building the most complicated siegeworks anyone in the city has ever seen, and he just abandoned them! Even now, his siege tower remains in place against the walls, a monument to his incompetence. What shall we do with these fearsome devices?"
 me_rhodes.4.a:0 "Find some buyers"
 me_rhodes.4.b:0 "Integrate them into the army"
 me_rhodes.4.c:0 "Study their construction method"
 me_rhodes.4.d:0 "Break it down for building materials"
 
 me_rhodes_5_title:0 "Siegeworks of Demetrios"
 me_rhodes_5_desc:0 "At long last, the hideous blight of the siege engines left behind by Demetrios has been taken care of. Not only have they been removed from where they were unceremoniously abandoned, which in itself has brought great joy to the city's inhabitants, but your decision regarding their ultimate fate is proving to reap dividends."
 me_rhodes.5.a:0 "One man's trash is another man's treasure"
 me_rhodes.5.b:0 "Our military is stronger than it was before"
 me_rhodes.5.c:0 "We have learned much about these weapons - truly a wise decision"
 me_rhodes.5.d:0 "Demetrios tried to destroy our city with this wood and stone, but we will use it to beautify Rhodes"
 
 me_rhodes_6_title:0 "Restoration of Rhodes: Securing Funds"
 me_rhodes_6_desc:0 "Although it pains you to admit it, the last few years have not been kind to the city of Rhodes itself. The city walls are still slightly damaged in some places, thanks to Demetrios, and there's a crumbling tower near the southern gate that is giving your lead architect nightmares. We should probably take care of this soon, but it's going to be expensive."
 me_rhodes.6.a:0 "[GetCountry('RHO').GetRuler.GetName] will cover the costs"
 me_rhodes.6.b:0 "Dig into the national treasury"
 me_rhodes.6.c:0 "Extort Party leaders"
 
 me_rhodes_7_title:0 "Rhodes Rebuilt"
 me_rhodes_7_desc:0 "The day has come for you to inspect the rebuilding projects you commissioned, and the repair site is abuzz with the anticipation of your arrival. As you run your eye along the stonework, you nod your head, turning to smile at your architect. You are known to be difficult to impress, especially when large sums of money are involved, but there is no denying that the work done has been excellent."
 me_rhodes.7.a:0 "Glorious!"
 
 me_rhodes_8_title:0 "The People of Kos"
 me_rhodes_8_desc:0 "The island of Kos is so close to us that we could practically sail there in a day's time if the winds favor us, and yet they call the faraway Ptolemies Master. Would it not benefit them if they became a part of our own realm? We shouldn't tolerate any foreign powers controlling islands near us anyways."
 me_rhodes.8.a:0 "Advocate for their Independence"
 me_rhodes.8.b:0 "Send an offer to become a feudatory"
 me_rhodes.8.c:0 "We don't need them!"
 
 me_rhodes_9_title:0 "The People of Knidos"
 me_rhodes_9_desc:0 "Tax revenues from the port district are not what they could be, and the reason for the lack of ships in your harbor is clear; the neighboring island of Knidos has become an attractive option for passing merchants, who are lured to their ports by Antigonid promises and coins. But enough is enough; it would benefit us to take control of the islands ourselves, or dislodge the Antigonids at the very least. How should we proceed?"
 me_rhodes.9.a:0 "Agitate for their independence"
 me_rhodes.9.b:0 "Send an offer to become a feudatory"
 me_rhodes.9.c:0 "We don't need them!"
 
 me_rhodes_10_title:0 "Independence of Kos"
 me_rhodes_10_desc_1:0 "Our messengers to Kos have returned with excellent news; they have agreed to what we have proposed, and have declared themselves independent of Ptolemaic control. Slowly but surely, we shall eliminate all other rivals from our waters."
 me_rhodes_10_desc_2:0 "The reply from Kos is laughable in its naivete; they are proud to be Ptolemaic dogs, content in their servitude. In fact, they ordered our embassy to leave the island immediately, once they knew what we were there for. Outrageous behavior!"
 me_rhodes.10.a:0 "As they should"
 me_rhodes.10.b:0 "Fools!"
 
 me_rhodes_11_title:0 "Kos: The Question of Kos"
 me_rhodes_11_desc_1:0 "Your embassy to Kos has returned to court, and when you see their beaming faces, you can't help but smile yourself. All good news; they have agreed to what we have proposed without hesitation. They will become our feudatory; the gods favor us!"
 me_rhodes_11_desc_2:0 "You can tell from the way your advisors are cowering this morning that whatever news they bring is unpleasant. A few minutes into the usual small talk, you wave your hand dismissively, demanding that they cut to the chase. 'The people of Kos...they have declined our offer'."
 me_rhodes.11.a:0 "A reason to celebrate!"
 me_rhodes.11.b:0 "Fools!"
 
 me_rhodes_12_title:0 "Independence of Knidos"
 me_rhodes_12_desc_1:0 "We have received good news from the embassy that we sent to Knidos; they have decided to seek their own destiny and have agreed to expel the Antigonid garrisons from their cities. This is an incredible diplomatic feat we have achieved."
 me_rhodes_12_desc_2:0 "The reply from Knidos is a bit more smug than you would have liked, but you shouldn't have expected anything less from those fools. Instead of seeking their own independence, they have decided to remain an Antigonid lapdog."
 me_rhodes.12.a:0 "Phenomenal!"
 me_rhodes.12.b:0 "How Unfortunate"
 
 me_rhodes_13_title:0 "Knidos: A New Subject"
 me_rhodes_13_desc_1:0 "The streets are filled with the joyful sounds of the aulos, uproarious laughter and the raucous type of celebration favored by Dionysos. You can't blame your people, as they have all of the reasons in the world to be happy; our neighbors Knidos have agreed to become our subject, and there is great rejoicing on both of our islands tonight. We enter a new age of prosperity together."
 me_rhodes_13_desc_2:0 "The response from Knidos is cloyingly sweet, perfumed nonsense that mask the emptiness of the words. While they appear to have mastered the art of court intricacies, they do not know a good idea when they see it, unfortunately. They will not become our feudatory."
 me_rhodes.13.a:0 "Phenomenal!"
 me_rhodes.13.b:0 "How Unfortunate"
 
 me_rhodes_14_title:0 "An Offer from Rhodes"
 me_rhodes_14_desc:0 "An embassy from the island of Rhodes has arrived at your court with an impudent request, but one that you have agreed to hear anyways. Considering themselves to greater than they are, they have requested that we abandon our interests in the island of Kos, stating that they consider it to be within their own sphere of influence. What shall we say?"
 me_rhodes.14.a:0 "Not a chance"
 me_rhodes.14.b:0 "We don't need them anyway"
 
 me_rhodes_15_title:0 "An Offer from Rhodes"
 me_rhodes_15_desc:0 "An embassy from the island of Rhodes has arrived in our port, their ships laden with fine goods and magnificent gifts that dazzle the eye and lighten the coinpurse. All of this wealth and more they promise us, if we agree to join their hegemony and become a feudatory to them. What do you think?"
 me_rhodes.15.a:0 "Not a chance"
 me_rhodes.15.b:0 "It is inevitable; let us submit to them"
 
 me_rhodes_16_title:0 "An Offer from Rhodes"
 me_rhodes_16_desc:0 "An embassy from the island of Rhodes has arrived at your court with an impudent request, but one that you have agreed to hear anyways. Considering themselves to greater than they are, they have requested that we abandon our interests in the island of Knidos, stating that they consider it to be within their own sphere of influence.

 me_rhodes.17.a:0 "Not a chance"
 me_rhodes.17.b:0 "It is inevitable; let us submit to them"
 
 me_rhodes_18_title:0 "The Matter of Lindos"
 me_rhodes_18_desc:0 "We should consider upgrading the province of Lindos, as it is becoming increasingly more and more important to the city of Rhodes itself. It is a testament to the growing power of our mighty city; we must make use of the hinterlands and make sure that we develop as much of our island as we can."
 me_rhodes.18.a:0 "Let's focus on increasing our trade and focus on commercial interests"
 me_rhodes.18.b:0 "Increasing our military might is always a good idea - divert resources to the military"
 me_rhodes.18.c:0 "We shall continue to expand our civic infrastructure in Lindos"
 me_rhodes.18.c.tt:0 "Choose a trade good to change #Y Lindos#! to"
 
 me_rhodes_19_title:0 "Trade Goods of Lindos"
 me_rhodes_19_desc:0 "While the region of Lindos is known and enjoyed for the variety of wine it produces, there are other types of goods that we could produce in this fertile area, if we so desired. Should we consider changing what is made there?"
 me_rhodes.19.a:0 "Stick to Wine@wine!"

 me_rhodes_20_title:0 "Cretan Ties: Sending an Offer to [crete_ally_country.GetName]"
 me_rhodes_20_desc:0 "Although we currently enjoy a warm relationship with Crete, it has recently been suggested at court that we expand our influence with them. We could go the usual route and spread some silver around, or we could try our hand at diplomacy and save a few coins. But maybe this is a bad idea after all...what should we do?"
 me_rhodes.20.a:0 "Gifts from the National Treasury"
 me_rhodes.20.b:0 "[GetCountry('RHO').GetRuler.GetName] will cover the costs"
 me_rhodes.20.c:0 "Extorting the Party leaders is always a great idea."
 me_rhodes.20.d:0 "Apply Political Pressure"
 me_rhodes.20.e:0 "A simple offer will do"
 me_rhodes.20.f:0 "We shall stay allies...for now"
 
 me_rhodes_21_title:0 "An offer from Rhodes"
 me_rhodes_21_desc:0 "At dawn, a grand fleet of ships was seen off the coast of Praisos, their proud heraldry resplendent in the early morning sunlight - Rhodes. A few hours later, their embassy stands before you with a polite, but firm, request; they have asked us if we would like expand our relationship by formally becoming their subject. They await your answer before they sail home immediately."
 me_rhodes.21.a:0 "We Accept"
 me_rhodes.21.b:0 "Not a chance"
 
 me_rhodes_22_title:0 "Cretan Ties: Response from [crete_ally_country.GetName]"
 me_rhodes_22_desc_1:0 "Your intuition and political savvy have paid off yet again - your embassy has returned from Crete and they have agreed to become our subjects. By degrees, our might continues to grow - we are unstoppable."
 me_rhodes_22_desc_2:0 "Well, the men we sent to Crete have returned. The Cretans have not only sent their regards in response, but also amphorae filled with local wines and some of the tastiest olives they grow on the island. Unfortunately for us, that is all we will get from them; they have politely declined our request."
 me_rhodes.22.a:0 "Great!"
 me_rhodes.22.b:0 "Those Fools!"
 
 me_rhodes_23_title:0 "A Merchant Navy"
 me_rhodes_23_desc:0 "The amount of gold and silver that our merchants bring to our markets grows every year; your income streams are merging to create a mighty river, and the entire nation is borne aloft on its powerful currents. We should reinvest our monies into the very fleets that make us wealthy; let us augment their numbers and watch the coins continue to roll in."
 me_rhodes.23.a:0 "Merchants will make Rhodes rich!"
 
 me_rhodes_24_title:0 "A Military Navy"
 me_rhodes_24_desc:0 "Rhodes has prospered mightily under our rule, responding to our excellent helmsmanship as we steer the ship of state through uncertain waters. But this is no time to rest on our laurels; if anything, we should continue to advance! Let us ensure our domination of the ocean by strengthening our military fleet."

 me_rhodes_26_desc:0 "At last, we have succeeded in our efforts to reorganize our navy, and have secured the services of a man named #Y Agesimbrotus#! who is a natural talent for command.
