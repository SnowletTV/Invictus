 roman_10_invading_britannia_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mysterious, fog-shrounded island of Britannia has become a refuge for Celtic brigands and thieves, who are foolish enough to believe that crossing the sea will protect them from Roman justice. While we have tolerated this for a long time, it has become apparent that we must take greater measures."

 # Tasks
 roman_10_secure_allies:0 "Acquire Preton Ally"
 roman_10_secure_allies_DESC:0 "No one knows the weaknesses of the Preton tribes better than their brothers. Befriending an important Celtic group may let the conquest of Britannia go more smoothly."
 roman_10_offer_britons_protection:0 "Offer Pretons Protection"
 roman_10_offer_britons_protection_DESC:0 "Intervening between a struggling Celtic tribe and foreign aggressors may be an opportunity to win us friendship and loyalty, though we will no doubt become embroiled in the melee - a price that we are willing to pay to further our goals."
 roman_10_secure_aremorica:0 "The Aremorican Coast"
 roman_10_secure_aremorica_DESC:0 "After conducting a survey, our engineers and architects have informed us that the coastline of Aremorica would be a valuable addition to our Gallic possessions. If we secure these lands for Rome, then we will be in a good position for invading the south of Britannia; Aremorica is the perfect staging ground for our navies."
 roman_10_secure_belgica:0 "The Belgian Coast"
 roman_10_secure_belgica_DESC:0 "While driving the fearsome Belgae from their coasts will be a Herculean task, we are left with no other options; the Belgae are refusing to co-exist peacefully, and your military advisors acknowledge that taking the ports of the Mare Britannicum is vital to eventually moving into Icania and Cantiacia."
 roman_10_belerion:0 "Conquer Belerion"
 roman_10_belerion_DESC:0 "Our invasion moves according to our designs; we have established our beachhead in Belerion and continue to send our troops further inland. Gods willing, it will only be a matter of time until we have fully secured the southwest of the island."
 roman_10_southern_england:0 "Conquer the Eastern Coast"
 roman_10_southern_england_DESC:0 "The price required for these eastern countries was steep, yet the Roman blood poured into these lands as a libation offering will not go unacknowledged by Mars! No barbarian tribe will be able to resist the march of civilization; we move north."
 roman_10_wales:0 "The Savage West"
 roman_10_wales_DESC:0 "As our troops move into the interior of the faraway isle of Britannia, resistance is becoming more and more fierce, yet these barbarians will not be able to delay the inevitable. When the savages of Demetia and Ordovicia have been annihilated, we will send a colony into these lands to ensure that Roman civilization takes root."
 roman_10_brigantia:0 "The Land of the Brigantes"
 roman_10_brigantia_DESC:0 "The Roman eagle flies over the misty moors and fog-choked marshes of Brigantia, its piercing shriek sending the woad-streaked barbarians to their knees in terror. Fly onward, and lead our Legions to eternal victory!"
 roman_10_scotland:0 "Subdue the Caledonii"
 roman_10_scotland_DESC:0 "How many Romans have been as far away from home as our troops in Caledonia now are? This is a cursed land, where the skies are grim and perpetually filled with rain. The tribes that inhabit these misty moors are throwing everything they can at us, hoping to drive us away; a foolish dream."
 roman_10_ireland:0 "The Island of Hibernia"
 roman_10_ireland_DESC:0 "As once Britannia was a refuge for Gallic mercenaries and troublemakers, who foolishly believed that they could escape Roman justice by simply sailing outside of our jurisdiction, so too has the island of Hibernia become a refuge for brigands and fugitives, murderers and thieves. Our possessions in the north are in danger unless we pacify this island."
 roman_10_hadrians_wall:0 "Vallum Aelium"
 roman_10_hadrians_wall_DESC:0 "The Caledonians are an unruly people, and although they have begrudgingly submitted to Roman authority after their overwhelming defeat, we know that honor is an unfamiliar concept to them. Trusting no one, we should build up our defenses at the foothills of the Caledonian highlands; this will protect our northern possessions from the fury of their raiding parties."
 roman_10_established_in_britannia:0 "Triumph in Britannia"
 roman_10_established_in_britannia_DESC:0 "As was anticipated, we have finally conquered the island of Britannia, adding another province to those we currently administer. While there are some logistical challenges involved in managing such a faraway region, we rise to the occasion, showing the entire world that the Romans are capable of accomplishing whatever we set our minds to. The Senate and the People of Rome are in your debt, Imperator."
 roman_10_northern_fleet:0 "Construct a Northern Fleet"
 roman_10_northern_fleet_DESC:0 "As our attention turns to the barbarous lands nearest to the dominions of Ocean, our need for a northern fleet, one that can transport our invading troops and supply them, has become apparent. Send word that construction should begin immediately, as prudence dictates we should not divert any of the fleets from Our Sea to these blasted hinterlands."
 roman_10_sulis_minerva:0 "Sulis Minerva"
 roman_10_sulis_minerva_DESC:0 "Aquae Sulis, a settlement situated by a hot spring that has become a place of pilgrimage for the locals as well as our own people, is a natural candidate for further Romanization. Let us turn this local shrine into a temple worthy of its newest inhabitants; perhaps the goddess that inhabits these cleansing waters will notice us."

Beckoning the soldier forward, you pour yourself a mug of posca and lean back in your chair, placing your maps to the side as you stifle a yawn. 'Imperator, we have received news from our men in the field. The gods are with us; the coast of Belgica is ours. While there are small pockets of resistance festering throughout the countryside, Victoria smiles upon us.

A steady rain has been falling all day, causing your men to grumble a little louder than you would normally accept, but the foul weather and fouler moods are not causing any serious delays in your plans. Dozens of Roman ships, loaded with soldiers, pack animals and all manner of provisions, gather along the horizon, and the salty air is filled with the cries of deckhands and their captains as they prepare to land. All of the commotion is easy to explain; now that the southwest of Britannia has been conquered, you have ordered that permanent fortifications be erected nearby, and you have come to observe the landing.
