01_salluvian_DESCRIPTION: "A puzzlework of distinct tribal identities, the #E Salluvians#! (or Salluvii, or Salyes) reside largely along the Druentia river near the famed Rhodanos river. A mixture of #E Ligurian#! and #E Celtic#! origins, they own the crossroads between the markets and cultures of #E Iberia#!, #E Gaul#!, and #E Italia#!. Sometimes traders, sometimes pirates, and sometimes equally both, the Salluvians occupy a distinct, yet shifting, position in the politics and economy of the Western Mediterranean, jostling with the Phocaean Greek colony of [GetProvince('(int32)2325').GetName] for market share in the trade of Gallic goods. Some say their conflicts with Massalia stretch back to the 6th century BCE.\n\nTo overcome the shortcomings of tribal structures, they will need to achieve unity and win respect in battle, even calling upon the aid of the most horrid gods of war and sacrifice."
01_salluvian_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Salluvian tribes have united, overcome the Massalian threat, and control an extensive domain within #E Gaul#!."

me_salluvian_15_desc: "For far too long, the pirates sailing out of [GetProvince('(int32)1469').GetName] have been a menace that no one has been able to deal with. The cruel Balearic islanders take delight in raiding our coastlines, stealing our kinsmen for their slave ships and setting fire to our settlements before returning to the safety of their homes.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], realizing that it was in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] power to stop this, ordered claims be prepared on the islands. The ambitious [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], sensing an opportunity to make a fortune, decided that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] would take over the pirating of the #E Mare Sardoum#! by right of conquest."
me_salluvian_15.a: "If no one can stop the pirates, then they can't stop us!"

me_salluvian_16_desc: "After riding for a few hours, our warriors encountered an #E Arvernian#! man walking down the road alone, and it was decided then and there that this poor soul would become a sacrifice to [GetDeityDefinition('omen_rudianos').GetName]. The Arvernian struggled mightily to resist capture but was only armed with a dagger and was no match for our party. The Gaul managed to wound a few of our number before being subdued and dragged before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who stood ready, sword in hand, to sever his head."
me_salluvian_16.a: "By the gods, I am bleeding...I will make you suffer"
me_salluvian_16.b: "I offer this head to [GetDeityDefinition('omen_rudianos').GetName]!"
me_salluvian_16_tooltip: "This option is available due to your ruler's #Y Martial#! skill."

me_salluvian_17_title: "The Rich Massilian Merchant"
me_salluvian_17_desc: "Our warriors stayed near the coast the entire time after they had crossed the rushing #E Rhodanus#!, and because they decided to stay close to the main roads, they soon encountered a merchant and his slave walking together, lost in deep conversation and unaware that they were crossing death's door. Moments later, the slave was on the ground, eyes staring lifelessly at the sky, and his bruised and bloodied master, a Massiliot name [SCOPE.sCharacter('poor_massalian_lost_head_scope').GetName], was on his knees, begging and pleading for his life.\n\n'Swear an oath to your gods that you free me, and I will take you to a buried treasure...I promise that I am not lying! I can give you gold...just promise you will spare my life!'"
me_salluvian_17.a: "What is this about buried treasure?"
me_salluvian_17.b: "Honoring the gods is the only gift I need"
me_salluvian_17_tooltip: "Our #Y Ruler#! accepts the ransom and frees the Massiliot prisoner."

me_salluvian_18_desc: "It was to the sound of a rejoicing throng that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] entourage returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], for the guards had let word spread that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] would be returning today.\n\nAs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] entered through the Western Gate, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] held in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] hands the severed head that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] had taken, proudly displaying it to the thousands gathered in the streets of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital - a gruesome sight that caused the massive crowds to cheer [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] name."

me_salluvian_19_desc: "The fear of an invading army from the east has kept [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] awake for many nights as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] contemplates what feels like an inevitability. While we have plenty of threats throughout #E Gaul#! that we still need to be mindful of, we cannot afford to ignore the threat that #E Italia#! represents.\n\nAfter considering our best options, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] implemented two initiatives simultaneously; our laborers would construct walls, ditches and strong fortifications all throughout the forests of [GetProvince('(int32)3541').GetName] while our armies trained in the same woodlands. Our warriors will soon get to know these forests like the back of their hands, using the terrain to their advantage as they strike without mercy. It is the hope of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that these efforts will make life difficult for any potential threats, but only time will tell if this will be enough."
me_salluvian_19.a: "Hopefully these walls will hold against the invader..."
