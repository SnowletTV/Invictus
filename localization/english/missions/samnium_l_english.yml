 samnium_mission:0 "The Samnites Strike Back" 
 samnium_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Twice have the Romans fought the us Samnites and twice we have lost, yet we shall recover and beat them. Third time's the charm, as they say - especially if we manage to array enough forces against them, for the Etruscans are amenable to an alliance and the Umbrians fear the Romans too. If we manage to create a coalition of the willing, Rome shall fall." 
 samnium_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have beaten our rival Rome." 
 samnium_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "'Roma Aeterna' is an empty claim we shall disprove."

 samnium_mission_2:0 "Fate of Samnium" 
 samnium_mission_2_DESCRIPTION:0 "After defeating the Romans, the Samnites are exposed to the Greek world, a world that entices many a spirit onto a path no virtuous Samnite would ever tread. Yet aren't we defined by our people? If all start to follow that path, maybe we are destined for it? Or maybe to the contrary, we have to extinguish all that is not Samnite in nature. \n\nImportant decisions lie ahead of you and their consequences will be felt the world over." 
 samnium_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have decided a direction for our future. Depending on the choices, this will range from the total conquest of Italy to Hellenizing to such an extent that we are no longer recognizable as a truly italic people with everything inbetween." 
 samnium_mission_2_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Samnium will rise like a phoenix from the ashes of the past, a bird so brilliant it cannot be described by words."

 # Decisions
 ver_sacrum:0 "Call for a Sacred Spring"
 ver_sacrum_desc:0 "The Ver Sacrum, or Sacred Spring, is most likely a rite originating during the Bronze Age to deal with overpopulation and start a migration of the young. While many cultures once had a similar tradition, only some Italic peoples still celebrate and go through with it to this day. \n\nWhen a sacred spring is called, all the young children ad cattle that are born in the spring of the following year will be 'devoted' to this rite and are considered to be under divine protection. Once they have reached maturity, they will be required to leave their community and are expected to create a new settlement, either by subjugating or exterminating the previous inhabitants or simply by settling uncolonized land. \nSome people think that originally, the 'devoted' children and cattle would be sacrificed.\n\nThe Roman practice of devotio is most likely related to the Ver Sacrum."

 samnium_event.1.t:0 "$samnium_task_1$"
 samnium_event.1.desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest consequence of our short-lived conflict with Tarentum is the political confidence inspired in our people due to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s able navigation of it. The balance of power between the Italics and the Greeks to our south is surely changed, but our involvement is proof of Samnium's place as one of the premier powers in the region. As tensions wind down and the Samnite troops stand down, our magistrates return to their fretting over the possibility of further interference by Greeks in the affairs of Italia. Nevertheless, life is returning to normalcy and we have reaped some minor rewards by our actions."
 samnium_event.1.a:0 "A minor victory for Samnium."

 samnium_event.2.t:0 "$samnium_task_2$"
 samnium_event.2.desc:0 "A final confrontation with the encroaching Romans is certain. Our diplomats and theirs have traveled the full length of the Italian peninsula to secure support from the many nations who have a stake in the future balance of power here, and we finally have firm promises of support. Our new allies have sent us a war stipend and some of their freemen have settled amongst us. Samnium has a fighting chance - now we wait for the moment."
 samnium_event.2.a:0 "Come, Roman wolf!"

 samnium_event.3.t:0 "$samnium_task_3$"
 samnium_event.3.desc:0 "Our people took severe losses during the last war with Rome, at Tarracina, on the plains of Apulia, and in the years of border raids and skirmishes on the Campanian frontier; but we have sought to recruit new soldiers from the many hard-living herdsmen of our country. They will be hammered into shape within the expanded training camps of our hillforts and urban centers, and outfitted with newly built bronze and iron helmets, cuirasses and weaponry. Our next generation of warriors will be numerous, well-equipped and drilled for battle."
 samnium_event.3.a:0 "From the stony hills of Samnium spring the Belliger Samnis"

 samnium_event.4.t:0 "$samnium_task_4$"
 samnium_event.4.desc:0 "Despite our recent history of conflict, the meager trade conducted between our leading families and those of Rome mean that a few young Samnite men are kicking around their cities - young men who are, perhaps, patriotic and in need of some spending money. Under-the-table influence and espionage may be possible."
 samnium_event.4.a:0 "I spy with my little eye..."

 samnium_event.5.t:0 "$samnium_task_5$"
 samnium_event.5.desc:0 "Our envoys have met and driven off the Fetial priests of Rome near the frontier - cutting short their ceremonial declaration of #E war#!, as our magistrates need not suffer their bloviating and impossible demands. We know where our nations stand. Our #E Belliger Samnis#! will soon meet their legions in the field, regain our lost lands, and take their revenge. The spirit of the Caudine Forks is with them!"

 samnium_event.6.t:0 "$samnium_task_6$"
 samnium_event.6.desc:0 "Our third great struggle with the Romans has come to an end. Our warriors collect their pay and return to their flocks and fields, as the endless task of raising sustenance from our infertile homeland must continue. The dead shall be buried, families returned to, and normal life resume. This decisive war pushed our nation to the brink and the period of recovery has begun. From the mountains to the valleys, Samnium is quiet."

 samnium_event.7.t:0 "$samnium_task_7$"
 samnium_event.7.desc:0 "The formerly great city of Rome - our nemesis - now lies smoldering. The Latins have always dealt viciously with our towns and now we have returned the favor. Our armies bring great spoils of gold and silver in their baggage trains. Many of the riches torn from their temples were originally looted from our cities in previous wars and are returning home. Many others were stolen from fellow Sabellic tribes and Etruscan cities over a century of Roman domination. It is now our temples which will display the trophies and our soldiers who will receive gifts of precious coins and heads of cattle and sheep. \n\n It is not just silver which we bring back from Rome. As we sacked their cities and fought their forces, we noted their advancements in civil planning and construction, their elaborate religious and diplomatic customs, and, above all, their martial technique. We can learn from their urban way of life. \n\n Our people are victorious and our coffers are fat."

The Latins have always sought to reduce our great nation to a rump client state, but this fate is now theirs. Their senate has signed an agreement of alliance with us, the sort of alliance in which Samnium will lead and Roman legions will follow. Please welcome the newest feudatory of the Samnite League! \n\n Taking the Romans' nascent empire from them is sure to break their dynamic spirit, perhaps for good, and a measure of autonomy will blunt the edge of their humiliation and guarantee their loyalty. Samnium provides both vinegar and honey. This is the wisdom of our leader, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. \n\n Our people are victorious and Rome is subjugated."
 samnium_event.8.a:0 "Rome falls! A day for rejoicing"

 samnium_event.9.t:0 "$samnium_task_9$"
 samnium_event.9.desc:0 "For generations, Samnite armies have clashed with Roman ones in desperate struggles across the peninsula. Our troops have always held the upper hand in our rough and hilly homeland. It was there that we captured an entire legion at the legendary Caudine Forks. Moving at lightning speed across the shepards' paths which crisscross Samnium and bloody raiding into Campania and the Liris valley has been our forte. In setpiece battles against Rome, however, their tactical brilliance has led to defeat and humiliation far more often than victory. \n\n This has changed. Through sheer hammering, Samnite iron has been shaped and it is our maniples which will be known as the most disciplined and effective force in Italy."

This is not to say that these nations are eager to subjugate themselves to us - we have a long history of conflict with the Frentani and the Nucerians in particular, and the Peligni and Marsi may wish to be freed not just from Rome, but from Samnium as well.
