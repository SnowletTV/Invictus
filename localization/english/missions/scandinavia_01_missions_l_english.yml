 me_scandinavia_1_desc: "Although most living within the civilizations of the south and east have never heard of the rugged forests of #E Scandia#! or its people, it is a thriving, vibrant place, one that is inhabited by a large number of tribes that constantly vie for supremacy against each other.\n\nAlthough no man knows the future, it is believed that the unification of the northern wildlands is inevitable...the histories await the arrival of the first ruler to unite #E Scandia#!."
 me_scandinavia_1.a: "I know who that person will be..."
 me_scandinavia_1_tooltip: "Time to make history..."

 me_scandinavia_2_title: "Herulia"
 me_scandinavia_2_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has never been one to deny [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] ambitions, and taking possession of the lands in the south of #E Scandia#! has long been a dream of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle].\n\nThe province of #E Herulia#! controls the all-important land crossing into the #E Cimbrian#! islands, which in turn are the doorway into the mainland of #E Europe#!. Securing these territories will give us a power that has hitherto been unknown to us, and will greatly increase our prestige in the region."

 me_scandinavia_3_title: "Ultima Thule"
 me_scandinavia_3_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had no problems understanding why the western coasts of #E Ultima Thule#! province were unclaimed, for the land itself was exceedingly poor, unable to sustain any meaningful agriculture, and wind-blasted and rain-soaked on top of that. Although there were some forested regions were valuable @woad! could be found, there wasn't much else worth mentioning; most of the scattered tribesmen living in Ultima Thule plied their trades at sea, relying on fishing to sustain their families because the hunting was terrible and no crops survived the devastating winters.\n\nDespite these limiting factors, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] realized the necessity of claiming these lands - we must not allow any of our rival claimants to power to gain ahold of territories that could benefit them. A plan was thus proposed by the #E Tribal Elders#!, one that would see our tribesmen sailing from the port at [GetProvince('(int32)6038').GetName] and building small villages along the coasts. It would be expensive, but we would be able to take over any lands that we currently did not control at once."

 me_scandinavia_5_desc: "The eastern territories of #E Scandia#! have always been special to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who has fond memories of summers spent traveling along the coasts in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] youth. The forests teeming with wildlife, the cold sea air that fills up your lungs and makes you feel truly alive for the first time in your life, the breathtaking coastline of imposing rocks jutting out of the frozen waters, the threat of wandering pirates and slave raiding parties...it has something for everyone.\n\nPerhaps it was nostalgia that pushed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to claim the region, but no matter what the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]'s motivations were, the outcome would be the same."
