 sogdia_missions:0 "Ten Thousand Hooves"
 sogdia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Long ago, the people of Sogdia lived their lives unencumbered by entanglements with others; this was in the period before the Achaemenids, led by Cyrus, conquered our lands and partitioned our borders into the nebulous state that they have remained in for centuries. The Persians and now the Greeks have entangled our fortunes with that of the Bactrians to our south, who have displaced us from our ancestral homes and bully us from their cities along the Oxus. Our independence from them is a recent thing; for years we were ruled as satraps of the Bactrians who in turn were ruled by others, reducing us to the servants of servants, but we are slaves no more, although whether or not we will be able to keep this freedom is an open question."
 sogdia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Sogdia has conquered some of its historic territory, secured the northern trade routes, and has established itself as a mighty economic power."
 sogdia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Some claim that Sogdia's best days are in the distant past, but we know better!"
