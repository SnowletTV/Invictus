### MISSIONS
 01_soodak_missions:0 "The Accursed Lands"
 01_soodak_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Located far beyond the reaches of even the hardiest of barbarian tribes, the wild lands collectively referred to as 'Hyperborea' are as vast as they are desolate, as cold as they are dark, and as inhospitable as any region known to man; even the sun god has begotten this accursed and wretched place. Yet, in spite of all logic or reason, we have decided that here is the place our precious colony shall be established, upon which our futures, lives, and fate shall be bound. With those few natives brave enough to call this place home now teaching us their ways of survival and of the moon goddess, '$omen_kuje$', along with continued support from the motherland, we not need the sun god's blessing, nor his curses."
 01_soodak_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "At the edge of the world, we will survive and thrive."
 01_soodak_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have become self-sufficient, colonized and developed the lands surrounding our island, and have forged our own identity."
 
 01_soodak_missions_task_1:0 "Securing The Food Supply"
 01_soodak_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Soodak, although rich in amber, is lacking in food supplies. We must have ample stores of food if we wish to endure the harsh winters."

 01_soodak_missions_task_100:0 "Assembling a Government"
 01_soodak_missions_task_100_DESC:0 "Now that we have found a way to survive on this barren island, though our temporary council has served us sufficiently, we need to establish a permanent system of governance should we wish to exist here long-term. However, the colonists are divided as to the form our government should take; some wish to expand the existing council into a house of burgesses, or a 'Burgzhusa', comprised of all the major stakeholders which would have the power to establish laws, while others would prefer having a royal governor installed from the homeland, who would reinforce our ties through dynastic houses and guide us towards prosperity. Still others, however, would suggest a hybrid system as a compromise, in-which a governor of non-royal stock would reign in-conjunction with our elected body. Yet, whatever we choose today will dictate the course of our colony for not only ourselves, but for our children and progeny yet to come."
 01_soodak_missions_task_100_tt:0 "We will have the option to reform our government into a #R Monarchy#!, a #Y Democratic Republic#!, or an #COLOR:{0.51,0.31,0.75} Oligarchic Republic with the Lifetime Elections law#!."
 
 01_soodak_missions_task_900:0 "An Androphagi Audience"
 01_soodak_missions_task_900_DESC:0 "In the desolate wastes of Hyperborea, few can bear the pain of the uncompromising, biting, and unrelenting cold for hours, let alone years on-end. Though their reputation is one of infamy and treachery of the most vile and blood-curdling manner, the hardy Androphagi are among the only tribes stubborn and foolish enough to make life work up here; if we are to continue walking in this place, we should attempt establishing a relationship with our neighbors."
 01_soodak_missions_task_900_tt:0 "We will send an expedition out to find these Androphagians..."

However, they have specifically requested a member of our royal house to guide them, and though our court is flattered by the idea, the thought of sending over a member of our dignified house to sully his hands over a backwater is, at-best, laughable to many of our closest advisors, who instead suggest it would be more befitting to send a bureaucrat of common stock instead."

He tells us the colony had sought to legitimize its tenuous position by placing a lesser royal from their motherland upon their throne, but that their tyrannical overlord refused, forcing them to look beyond their borders for a leader noble enough to guide them. Though we can accomodate their request and place a member of our own family upon the #E [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_country').GetName]#! throne, they are but a colony, a foreign one at that, and doing so would provoke #E [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_overlord').GetName]#!. Yet, this would also be an opportunity drive a wedge between #E [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_overlord').GetName]#! and its colony, weakening their empire at a minimal cost to us."

Not only have they blatently defied our authority, however, they have also drastically raised the stakes by placing a foreigner in-charge, from the barbarians of #E [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_foreign_nobility_target').GetName]#!, no-less, straining ties with the benevolent motherland and underming our authority; people throughout the capital are irate, denouncing Soodakers for their treachary and disloyalty, and our closest advisors say that they have left us with no other alternative but to impose harsh sanctions upon our colony to bring it back in-line."

 me_soodak_109_desc:0 "We meant no ill-will towards our dear motherland, but unfortunately they have seen fit to impose harsh and cruel sanctions upon our colony until we install their governor of choice, targeting our vital food shipments and redirecting merchant vessels towards Scandia instead. Though we are self-sufficient now and can withstand the blows, the cost will be high, and many are contemplating sending our recently-appointed ruler back to #E [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_foreign_nobility_target').GetName]#!."

 me_soodak_901_desc:0 "After months of searching, though our expedition was able to eventually locate the site our sources told was the mythical Androphagian heartland, unfortunately all that remains of this once-thriving settlement are the abandoned derelicts of huts, dark scorches of ash which scar and blight the land, and a distinctly-unpleasant tinge of human flesh permeating the bitter air. After scouting more deeply into the woods, foragers and stragglers were found in the vicinity, who regale that this was, in-fact, where the Androphagi once dwelt, but they were unexpectedly attacked by greater force, resulting in their complete destruction as a people. Seeing as these wanderers lacked a home and were adept at living off this accursed land, the leader of our expedition offered for them to join with us at Soodak, who will now doubtlessly prove invaluable in developing our own settlement."

 me_soodak_902_desc:0 "Nearly a year has passed since our expedition set out in search of the Androphagi, but we still have not heard back from them, and they should have dispatched a messager of some-kind by this point to inform us of their progress. There are fears in Soodak that they may have gotten lost, or even, that they may have run out of adequit provisions and died on the journey. There are many clamoring for us to send a follow-up expedition to try finding them before they starve, or at the very-least locate their bodies for a proper burial. What should we do?"
 me_soodak_902.a:0 "Send a follow-up expedition, we need to save our people while we still can!"

 me_soodak_903_desc:0 "Over a year ago, we sent an expedition deep into the far-reaches of Hyperborea, hoping to find the mythical tribe of the Androphagi. However, after it became apparent that the expedition had not returned, we assumed them to be dead, and didn't bother sending a follow-up team. Now, months later, during the middle of the night, a half-starved man crawled to the city gates, delirious, dehydrated, and terribly frost-bitten. After spending the night in the care of our most-esteemed shaman, he started to recover, and we were able to piece together his story. Apparently this man was a member of the ill-fated expedition, which had run into a particularly-bad blizzard, forcing them to shelter within a nearby cave. Unfortunately, the entrance was quickly snowed-in, trapping them for weeks, and were not sent with enough of the vital supplies to survive until the thaw. Perhaps a follow-up expedition could have helped break through the snow and ice, but one never came, and their desperate cries for help rang hollow; as a result, those unlucky-few who were still alive were forced to resort to cannibalism. Finally, the snow melted, and this survivor was able to wander through the woods alone and miraculously find his way back to Soodak alive."
