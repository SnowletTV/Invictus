### MISSIONS
 01_soodak_missions:0 "The Accursed Lands"
 01_soodak_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Located far beyond the reaches of even the hardiest of barbarian tribes, the wild lands collectively referred to as '#G Hyperborea#!' are as vast as they are desolate, as cold as they are dark, and as inhospitable as any region known to man; even the sun god has begotten this accursed and wretched place. Yet, in spite of all logic or reason, we have decided that here is the place our precious colony shall be established, upon which our futures, lives, and fate shall be bound. With those few natives brave enough to call this place home now teaching us their ways of survival and of the moon goddess, '$omen_kuje$', along with continued support from the motherland, we not need the sun god's blessing, nor his curses."
 01_soodak_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "At the edge of the world, we will survive and thrive."
 01_soodak_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have become self-sufficient, colonized and developed the lands surrounding our island, and have forged our own identity."
 
 01_soodak_missions_task_1: "Securing The Food Supply"
 01_soodak_missions_task_1_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T], although rich in amber @amber!, is lacking in food supplies. We must have ample stores of food if we wish to endure the harsh winters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_2: "The Shores Of Anoppi"
 01_soodak_missions_task_2_DESC: "Though we have established stable stores of food on our amber-rich isle, it still leaves much to be desired, and across the sea lies a coastline whose waters are teeming with bountiful quantities of fish @fish!, at least for #G Hyperborean#! standards; by establishing a second settlement there, we will not only help to secure more food for our colony, but will also give us a foothold on the mainland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"
 01_soodak_missions_2_reward_tt: "#Y 2#! pops will arrive from the mainland and will settle in [GetProvince('(int32)9373').GetName|T]."

 01_soodak_missions_task_3: "A Sea-Faring Fleet"
 01_soodak_missions_task_3_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T] is a glorious amber-mining colony positioned on the northernmost periphery of the known world, yet, we lack the infrastructure needed for ships to safely dock at our natural harbor, the port facilities to repair those which do come our way, and merchant vessels of our own when none others are brave enough to cross these lattitutes, grievously hindering our economic potential; by investing our rather-limited resources into a servicable port and a fleet of simple transport ships, not-only shall we be able to draw more curious and wealthy visitors to our island, but we will have the capacity to send our own independent expeditions across the high seas and into uncharted river systems without relying on the motherland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_4: "A Soodaker Sauna?"
 01_soodak_missions_task_4_DESC: "It is very much cold on this island during the wintertime, often requiring adults to be heavily clothed at all times to avoid a freezing death, even within the confines of a protected shelter. However, the native #G Fennic#! peoples of the area have developed a unique innovation they call 'saknas', or 'saunas', in which heated rocks are placed in the center of a covered pit, and then cooled with water as to concoct a hot steam through which the air becomes saturated and engorged, enducing a state of relaxation among its residents and spreading a generious summertime warmth unlike any seen with a traditional hearth; in-fact, a heat so-generous as to allow those in attendence to strip nakid and bare. Though many of our colonists are skeptical of such exotic and unsavory rituals associated with our barbarian neighbors, said-neighbors have lived here for millenia, and many of our people would yet benefit from having a warm bath once in awhile; by building public 'saunas' throughout our capital, people will be encouraged to adopt the practice, increasing the habitability of these wicked and wretched lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_5: "Recruit Extra Settlers"
 01_soodak_missions_task_5_DESC: "Though our colony has achieved a remarkable degree of self-sufficiency, given our disposition, we suffer from a distinctive lack of people with which our meager successes can be enjoyed; by offering vague financial incentives and greatly-exaggerated promises of prosperity to those residing within the overcrowded cities of our motherland, we will expand upon our colonial bedrock, laying the foundation for more settlements beyond [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T] itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_5_tt: "Between #Y 3#! and #Y 12#! pops from the motherland will arrive on #Y Soodak#!."

 01_soodak_missions_task_6: "An Insidious Scheme"
 01_soodak_missions_task_6_DESC: "Many of our influential stakeholders have taken note that more settlers arrive during times of tension and strife within the homeland, the fear of persecution driving people to instead take their chances within our frozen wilderness. Though we are kith and kin to our motherland, given the tempting fact we benefit off of their misfortunes, some of our advisors have suggested a scheme so radical and insidious as to stir considerable controversy within the highest echelons of our colonial administration: We intentionally destabilize our overlord's society by funding agitators, dissedents, and pretenders to poke at various fault lines and areas of authority, as to make [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T] a more-attractive destination. The very thought is treasonous, and should we be caught at any stage of planning, the consequences would be swift as they would immense, yet, the rewards may be equally beneficial...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil17!"
 01_soodak_missions_6_reward_tt: "We will have the chance to get 20-30 pops of our primary culture and religion."
 01_soodak_missions_6_warning_tt: "#R WARNING!#! Should we be discovered, we will face extreme punishment."

 01_soodak_missions_task_7: "Reinforce The Amber Supply"
 01_soodak_missions_task_7_DESC: "Our colony was primarily founded out of a desire to extract the precious amber @amber! teeming beneath the mud, yet, despite our best efforts, output has not reached levels matching expectations. Fortunately for us, there lies another amber deposit across the bay from the capital, ripe for settlement and exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"
 01_soodak_missions_7_reward_tt: "#Y 3#! pops will arrive from the mainland and will be distributed between [GetProvince('(int32)9374').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)9375').GetName|T]."

 01_soodak_missions_task_8: "The Breadbasket Of Nato"
 01_soodak_missions_task_8_DESC: "Though we have access to fish year-round, we import much of our food from abroad, and lack a backup plan in-case those networks were to be disrupted for a prolonged period. To the east, the forests of [GetProvince('(int32)9378').GetName|T] are just-fertile enough to support the growing of sturdy grains during the summer, and the adjacent marsh of [GetProvince('(int32)9379').GetName|T] is quite adequate for the rearing hardy livestock. Though not as agreeable a palette to those foreign imports, by establishing settlements in these territories, we will ensure more domestic food production, and perhaps facilitate expansion deeper into the interior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil2!"
 01_soodak_missions_8_reward_tt: "#Y 2#! pops will arrive from the mainland and will be distributed between [GetProvince('(int32)9378').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)9379').GetName]."

 01_soodak_missions_task_9: "The Northern Shore"
 01_soodak_missions_task_9_DESC: "The northern coastline is barely-habitable and not particularly lucrative, lacking both in amber and food supplies, and yet, it has the potential to reduce our reliance upon the motherland; the red clay of [GetProvince('(int32)9372').GetName|T] is particularly-suited for crafting earthenware @earthware! in which our wares can be stored, and the wild hemp @hemp! of [GetProvince('(int32)9377').GetName|T] can be cultivated for rope vital for masts and various constructions. By colonizing and developing the north today, we set ourselves up for a better tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_10: "Our Home Secured"
 01_soodak_missions_task_10_DESC: "After years of effort in colonizing the surrounding territories, establishing new outposts, and taming the vast wilderness of our new home, we have ceased being a tiny amber-mining island, and now find ourselves masters of the whole of #Y Ilmandu Superior#!, a shining beacon of civilization burning through the shroud of the ever-lasting winter darkness. Yet, in spite of our most-impressive achievement, we have opened the door to further expansion and conquest far beyond our motherland's vision and expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil2!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_11: "The Timber Of Nooli"
 01_soodak_missions_task_11_DESC: "Along the shores of #Y Lake Peipus#! lies a dense forest with plenty of hardy and disease-resistant wood @wood! to be harvested, perfect for constructing shelters, ships, and even firewood, along with sources of nutritious vegetables @vegetables! and leather-bearing game @wild_game! in the nearby vicinity. In claiming these interior lands, we lessen our need for reliance upon the motherland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil7!"
 01_soodak_missions_11_reward_tt: "#Y 3#! pops of our primary culture and religion will be distributed between [GetProvince('(int32)9382').GetName|T], [GetProvince('(int32)9380').GetName|T], and [GetProvince('(int32)9383').GetName|T]."

 01_soodak_missions_12: "Across The Peipus"
 01_soodak_missions_task_12_DESC: ""

 01_soodak_missions_task_13: "To The River Vain"
 01_soodak_missions_task_13_DESC: "Though we have established a presence in #T Ilmandu Inferior#!, it is but a mere toehold over lands which are abundant in key resources, marginally warmer and more hospitable then our capital area, and, most importantly, run parallel to the #Y River Vain#!, a major trade artery which penetrates deep into #G Hyperborea#!. By claiming these lands, not only will we be able to exert our influence deeper into the wilderness, but we will be able to monopolize all Baltic-bound trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_14: "Beyond The Velho"
 01_soodak_missions_task_14_DESC: "To the remote and vast east lies a river to which locals refer as the #Y 'Velho'#!, which they say leads beyond #G Hyperborea#! to the wild lands not yet known to civilization. Though it will be a costly endeavor, by establishing outposts in and around the lands surrounding this river, we will be able to establish trade networks with those lost to history, and perhaps set the stage for new expeditions beyond the tree line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil32!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_15: "Turn To The Moon Goddess"
 01_soodak_missions_task_15_DESC: "Though we have long-maintained our faith in our gods, given our hardship and struggles, some are beginning to question their faith in us, and in-particular of the sun-god, whose presence, or lack thereof, has led many to the conclusion he has cursed us. The #G Fennic#! tribesmen of this area, having lived here for generations, instead worship the moon goddess, #G $omen_kuje$#!, whose presence, on the contrary, is plainly-visible during the long and deadly winter months, whom they claim shields their people from the greatest evils of the darkest nights; in-fact, her cult has now gained a following among our settlers, beleiving they too will gain her protection.\n\nThough this will spark uproar among our priests, who denounce such converts as misguided fools whose heresy will only further anger the sun-god, by formally embracing #G $omen_kuje$#! into our pantheon, perhaps we likewise will bask in her blessings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_15_tt: "Up to #Y 6#! pops in the capital will convert to #Y $uralic_pantheon$#!."
 01_soodak_missions_task_15_tt2: "#R This task is mutually-exclusive with '#T $01_soodak_missions_task_16$#!'#!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_16: "Reinforce The Old Gods"
 01_soodak_missions_task_16_DESC: "Though we have long-maintained our faith in our gods, given our hardship and struggles, some are beginning to question their faith in us, and in-particular of the sun-god, whose presence, or lack thereof, has led many to the conclusion he has cursed us. As a result, the heathen cult of #G $omen_kuje$#! has begun to spread among many of our colonists, disillusioned by destitution and misguided by false promises, whose heresy our priests warn will only further anger the sun-god; to ensure our salvation, we need to double-down and reinforce the traditional Germanic rites by offering extravigant sacrifices and indulging on great temples. Only then shall we make peace with our gods and lift this curse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil16!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_16_tt: "The capital has a #Y $temple_building$#! building."
 01_soodak_missions_task_16_tt2: "#R This task is mutually-exclusive with '#T $01_soodak_missions_task_15$#!'#!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_17: "Request Financial Aid"
 01_soodak_missions_task_17_DESC: "We are a proud colony which has managed to achieve stability, both political and financial, as well as secure borders. It is only-fitting that we request financial aid from our generous motherland, as a reward for our efforts and such that we may endeavor to grow further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_17_tt: "We will have the option ask our overlord for a financial boon, either #Y 50#!, #Y 250#!, or #Y 500#! gold, but the more we request, the less-likely they are to oblidge."

 01_soodak_missions_task_18: "The Ultimate Sacrifice"
 01_soodak_missions_task_18_DESC: "We have appeased the #T Sun-God#! for now, yet, our priests inform us to truly rid ourselves of this wretched curse, we must spread genuine zeal and passionate belief among the native inhabitants of these surrounding lands, akin to a forest of ignorance set aflame with the light of knowledge and understanding. Though many may profess loyalty to the gods in one hand, in the other, they still follow the spirits of their ancestors. To prove the worthiness of our gods over those of all others within the hearts and minds of these tribesmen, from now until Ragnarok, there can only be one way; our leadership undertaking the ultimate sacrifice, setting an honorable example for those, both now and in the future, to emulate during times of great crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil17!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_18_tt: "#R WARNING!#! Either our #Y Ruler#! or #Y High Priest#! will be sacrificed to appease the #T Sun-God#!."
 01_soodak_missions_task_18_tt2: "Has greater then or equal to #Y 60#! religious unity."

 01_soodak_missions_task_19: "Intertwine With The Mainland"
 01_soodak_missions_task_19_DESC: "Though we may have had differences in the past, our overlord remains our generous protector and sovereign, whose vastly superior strength, both military and economic, is better engaged with as a friend and partner, rather then as a competitor; thus, it is in our natural interests to better-link our economies by investing into our market centers and reducing restrictions on Germanic imports, thereby benefitting both parties in a mutual fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!" #reducing import restrictions and export duties
 01_soodak_missions_task_19_tt: "#R This task is mutually-exclusive with '#T $01_soodak_missions_task_24$#!'#!."

 01_soodak_missions_task_20: "Purchase Gutinland"
 01_soodak_missions_task_20_DESC: "As our colony becomes more intertwined with the mainland, the line between [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T] and #G Germania#! becomes blurred, akin to a heavy morning fog hanging above the water and beneath the sky. In this regard, we are less a vassal then autonomous province, existing to aid our overlord in administering these far-flung lands.\n\nThough outside our designated region, the island of [GetProvince('(int32)6010').GetName|T] lies closer to our capital then to our motherland's, which would allow us to exert more control over it, and thus, reap more taxes from it, not to mention the increased trade we would bring throughout the Baltic. Perhaps we could sway Germania to cede this island to our administration and allow us to govern in their name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil21!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_20_tt: "We will attempt to purchase the island of #Y [GetProvince('(int32)6010').GetName|T]#! from our overlord."
 01_soodak_missions_task_20_tt2: "The capital of our overlord is not on #Y [GetProvince('(int32)6010').GetName|T]#!."

 01_soodak_missions_task_21: "Request Military Advisors"
 01_soodak_missions_task_21_DESC: "Though our militia has served us well along the frontier, to have a force truly capable of supporting the motherland during a time of crisis, we need to reform our collection of rag-tag forces into a true standing army; to that end, by requesting some of the finest military advisors from our overlords, we will be able to lean on their experience gained through years of warfare and gain access cutting-edge tactics for the battlefields of tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_21_tt: "We will receive a high-martial general."
 01_soodak_missions_task_21_tt2: "We have at least one #Y $military_building$#! building."

 01_soodak_missions_task_22: "The Amber Boom"
 01_soodak_missions_task_22_DESC: "The amber @amber! mined from [GetProvince('(int32)9371').GetName|T] is the pride of our administration, its vibrant-orange crystal among the finest from anywhere found in the world, and yet, even with plenty of investment, there still remains plenty more to mine and refine. Our financial advisors speculate that with its unrivalled popularity back home, there is potential for an #Y 'Amber Boom'#!, so to speak, if only we were to kickstart it through constructing an initial quantity of foundaries, thereby attracting wealthier businessmen from the mainland to run them, who in-turn, would import more workers to dredge more of this incredibly-valuable substance to refine and sell abroad. It is a cyclical cycle of profit and wealth just waiting at our fingertips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil9!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_22_tt: "We will gain #Y 10#! pops in every #Y $amber$#!-producing territory or city we own."

 01_soodak_missions_task_23: "The Crown Jewel Of Germania" #Not including [SCOPE.sCountry('soodak_overlord').GetName] to prevent edge-case errors
 01_soodak_missions_task_23_DESC: "Generations ago, we began as a wayward colony, a backwater whose only purpose was to mine and harvest amber @amber! for our overlords, in terrain too treacherous to do themselves. Through our successes, we came to dominate the market, and drawing an influx of settlers, grew in mirror of our homeland, with the government being organized according to a civilized fashion, cities erect in the wilderness, and the vicious barbarians pacified; a glassy reflection, tinted a precious orange. As we have continued to interwtine our economy, diplomacy, and lives with that of our overlords, we have gained a deserved reputation for trustworthyness and loyalty, an extension of #G Germania#! itself, and through our wealth, a title by which we have been affectionately awarded: the crown jewel of the empire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_24: "Decouple From The Mainland"
 01_soodak_missions_task_24_DESC: "Though few are willing to discuss the topic in public, our current arrangement with the motherland is increasingly untenable, who does right by us on occasion, but increasingly imposes harsher taxes upon our people, while conversely further-neglecting our needs. Independency, as some have argued, is still a step too far, yet, we should begin the process of decoupling ourselves from the mainland, so should the worst come to to pass, we will be prepared."
 01_soodak_missions_task_24_tt: "We are not importing any trade goods from our overlord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil17!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_25: "Reform The Militia"
 01_soodak_missions_task_25_DESC: "Our militia has served us well along the frontier, yet, our collection of rag-tag forces is hardly in-shape to contend with the might of the #G Germanic Empire#!, whose home-made shields and old, rusty swords would get smashed to pieces by the disciplined legions of the latter. We need a man with a plan, and fortunately for us, our contacts tell us of a capable general from [GetProvince('(int32)3967').GetName|T], who, after being pushed out of the Germanic military by an influential rival, is willing and able to serve our cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil9!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_26: "Embrace The $uralic_pantheon$ Pantheon"
 01_soodak_missions_task_26_DESC: "With the #T Moon Goddess#!' blessings, despite the priests' misgivings, our people have prospered beyond what many would have deemed possible years prior, with fertile rains during summertime blessing our harvests, and the howling winter storms causing less damage. The old order maintains that these are merely coincidences, but the people have long-lost confidence in them and the gods they claim to represent; by sweeping away the archaic and corrupted priesthood with men who have a genuine connection with the true gods, we will ensure prosperity for our people, and crush this curse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic13!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_26_tt: "We have at least #Y 2#! $uralic_pantheon$ deities in our pantheon."

 01_soodak_missions_task_27: "Enlarge The Militia"
 01_soodak_missions_task_27_DESC: "Our militia has served us well along the frontier, and though it is inferior in quality to many of the great armies around the world, realistically, that is a perfection we will never be able to match. Therefore, it is logical to invest into quantity, and by allowing citizens of all ages and fitness to answer the call to war, we will be able to eek the most from our countryside, and without a standing army, we shall ease concerns of an independent government abusing its power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil5!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_27_tt: "#R This task is mutually-exclusive with '#T $01_soodak_missions_task_25$#!'#!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_28: "Incorporate Native Knowledge"
 01_soodak_missions_task_28_DESC: "The #G Fennic#! peoples have lived in this land for generations, and therefore are quite knowledgeble about this terrain, with information of where wild berries grow during times of scarcity, where wild animals reside, and the best spots in which to set traps for world-be conquerors. By incorporating and learning from the strategies of our allies, we will make the enemy fight for every inch of snow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_29: "A Germano-Fennic Union"
 01_soodak_missions_task_29_DESC: "Our relationship with the #G Fennic#! people has not always been an easy one, however, now that we worship the same gods and follow the same spirits, many across both sides of the isle starting to see that we share more similarities then differences, especially in regards to our mutual grievences against the overlord. With no clear-cut divisors after generations of intermixing, it is becoming harder to differentiate between #G Germanic#! and Fennic, particularly under the faint rays of #T $omen_kuje$#!'s blessed moonlight. Therefore, for the future perserverence of our colony, it is only fitting we recognize the situation on the ground, and formally abolish the remaining legal distinctions between our two peoples, creating a more-perfect union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil11!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_30: "The Lands Of Joki"
 01_soodak_missions_task_30_DESC: "At first-glance, there is not much to say about the lands of #T $joki_area$#!, with its thick forests and dense swamps making habitation less-then ideal. However, our scouts report it sits at a critical juncture between the rivers #Y Velho#! and #Y Vain#!, an area of vital strategic importance, given our holdings in both of those provinces; in colonizing this wild land, we will not only guarantee strategic autonomy for our eastern territories, but also facilitate our administration therein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

 01_soodak_missions_task_100: "Assembling A Government"
 01_soodak_missions_task_100_DESC: "Now that we have found a way to survive on this barren island, though our temporary council has served us sufficiently, we need to establish a permanent system of governance should we wish to exist here long-term. However, the colonists are divided as to the form our government should take; some wish to expand the existing council into a house of burgesses, or a #T'Burgzhusa'#!, comprised of all the major stakeholders which would have the power to establish laws, while others would prefer having a royal governor installed from the homeland, who would reinforce our ties through dynastic houses and guide us towards prosperity. Still others, however, would suggest a hybrid system as a compromise, in-which a governor of non-royal stock would reign in-conjunction with our elected body. Yet, whatever we choose today will dictate the course of our colony for not only ourselves, but for our children and progeny yet to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil5!"
 01_soodak_missions_task_100_tt: "We will have the option to reform our government into a #R Monarchy#!, a #Y Democratic Republic#!, or an #COLOR:{0.51,0.31,0.75} Oligarchic Republic with the Lifetime Elections law#!."

 01_soodak_missions_task_900_DESC: "In the desolate wastes of #G Hyperborea#!, few can bear the pain of the uncompromising, biting, and unrelenting cold for hours, let alone years on-end. Though their reputation is one of infamy and treachery of the most vile and blood-curdling manner, the hardy #R Androphagi#! are among the only tribes stubborn and foolish enough to make life work up here; if we are to continue walking in this place, we should attempt establishing a relationship with our neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil13!"

Perhaps a follow-up expedition could have helped break through the snow and ice, but one never came, and their desperate cries for help rang hollow; as a result, those unlucky-few who were still alive were forced to resort to cannibalism.

 me_soodak_904_desc:0 "Over a year ago, we sent an expedition deep into the far-reaches of Hyperborea, hoping to find the mythical tribe of the Androphagi. However, after it became apparent that the expedition had not returned, we sent a follow-up expedition in the hopes of locating any survivors. Unfortunately, the follow-up team has not returned either, leaving many to assume the worst and question your wisdom in sending yet-more people to die. Although we could send a third expedition, nobody in Soodak would be willing to volunteer for such an excursion, given recent history."

However, after it became apparent that the expedition had not returned, we sent a follow-up expedition in the hopes of locating any survivors. Fortunately, while they were patrolling a nearby cave which had been snowed-in, the follow-up team was able to hear cries for help from inside, and worked to break through the snow and ice to reach the survivors, who had run out of food and were considering resorting to cannibalism. They have been brought back, and though they did not find the Androphagi, have returned home as heros, a shining example of Soodak determination, grit, and resourcefulness, reflecting greatly upon your decision-making and on our colony as a whole."

The Androphagi devoured them all on the spot, akin to a pack of ravenous dogs, save for a stuffed hand, which they have sent back as a message to let us know our people were 'treated well at the hands of their hosts,' adding that we 'are welcome to send more treats their way'."
