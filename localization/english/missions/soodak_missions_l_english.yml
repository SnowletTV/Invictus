### MISSIONS
 01_soodak_missions:0 "The Accursed Lands"
 01_soodak_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Located far beyond the reaches of even the hardiest of barbarian tribes, the wild lands collectively referred to as 'Hyperborea' are as vast as they are desolate, as cold as they are dark, and as inhospitable as any region known to man; even the sun god has begotten this accursed and wretched place. Yet, in spite of all logic or reason, we have decided that here is the place our precious colony shall be established, upon which our futures, lives, and fate shall be bound. With those few natives brave enough to call this place home now teaching us their ways of survival and of the moon goddess, '$omen_kuje$', along with continued support from the motherland, we not need the sun god's blessing, nor his curses."
 01_soodak_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "At the edge of the world, we will survive and thrive."
 01_soodak_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have become self-sufficient, colonized and developed the lands surrounding our island, and have forged our own identity."
 
 01_soodak_missions_task_1:0 "Securing The Food Supply"
 01_soodak_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "Soodak, although rich in amber, is lacking in food supplies. We must have ample stores of food if we wish to endure the harsh winters."

 #Tasks
 01_soodak_missions_task_900:0 "An Androphagi Audience"
 01_soodak_missions_task_900_DESC:0 "In the desolate wastes of Hyperborea, few can bear the pain of the uncompromising, biting, and unrelenting cold for hours, let alone years on-end. Though their reputation is one of infamy and treachery of the most vile and blood-curdling manner, the hardy Androphagi are among the only tribes stubborn and foolish enough to make life work up here; if we are to continue walking in this place, we should attempt establishing a relationship with our neighbors."
