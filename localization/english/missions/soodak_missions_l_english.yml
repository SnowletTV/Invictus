### MISSIONS
 01_soodak_missions:0 "The Accursed Lands"
 01_soodak_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Located far beyond the reaches of even the hardiest of barbarian tribes, the wild lands collectively referred to as 'Hyperborea' are as vast as they are desolate, as cold as they are dark, and as inhospitable as any region known to man; even the sun god has begotten this accursed and wretched place. Yet, in spite of all logic or reason, we have decided that here is the place our precious colony shall be established, upon which our futures, lives, and fate shall be bound. With those few natives brave enough to call this place home now teaching us their ways of survival and of the moon goddess, '$omen_kuje$', along with continued support from the motherland, we not need the sun god's blessing, nor his curses."
 01_soodak_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "At the edge of the world, we will survive and thrive."
 01_soodak_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have become self-sufficient, colonized and developed the lands surrounding our island, and have forged our own identity."
