# Mission DESC
saba_mission: "Return Of The Sabaean Kingdom"
saba_mission_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, our kingdom of #E Saba#! was the dominant power in our corner of the #E Arabian Peninsula#!; we controlled the trade routes of the Sinus Arabicus, and our neighbors were forced to submit to our authority...but these days are long gone.\n\nRevolts in our north and south saw our former vassals, #E Ma'in#! and #E Qataba#!, break free from our control, and they have been pressing hard against us ever since. Although the road ahead is fraught with unknown dangers, we cannot continue as we are; we must fight against the march of history and restore our nation to greatness!"
saba_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be complete once we have halted our decline and started to rise again by re-establishing our power."
saba_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The sand has almost run through our hourglass, and yet still we press forward!"

qataba_mission: "The Kingdom of Qataba"
qataba_mission_DESCRIPTION: "The #E Kingdom of Qataba#! has been a rival of the #E Kingdom of Saba#!, our erstwhile overlords, for as long as anyone in our tribe can remember, and the march of time has done nothing to dissipate the bitter feelings we carry towards our neighbors. It has been almost two hundred years since we liberated ourselves from the Sabaean yoke, and we nearly equal our former master in strength, economically and militarily.\n\nThe time has come to finish the business that our grandfathers started - we must destroy those that stand in the way of a unified Arabia. "
qataba_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete once we have subdued the Sabaean Kingdom and consolidated southern Arabia."
qataba_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We shall have our revenge..."

south_arabia_mission: "Arabian Dreams"
south_arabia_mission_DESCRIPTION: "Myrrh, incense, spices, silver and gold - an unfathomable amount of high-end trade passes through our realm, giving birth to our dream; to become so rich as to be the envy of the gods themselves."
south_arabia_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete once we have established control over the #Y Horn of Africa#! and once we have formed #Y Arabia#!."
south_arabia_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The time has come to build an economic empire, one that currently exists only in our dreams..."
