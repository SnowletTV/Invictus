 spartan_mission_01_laconia:0 "Spartan Restoration"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Sparta have by many been tossed aside like an artifact of the past. It is time for us to rise up and prove them all wrong."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_DESCRIPTION:0 "We have been ravaged by ambitious foreign warlords jealous of the might of Sparta, leaving us weakened and without our allies and subjects of old. If we are to become an important regional actor in Greece again, we need to restore the city of Sparta to its former glory and put an end to our local rivals."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when you have conquered and consolidated all of Laconia."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_1:0 "Spartan Resurgence"

 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_2_DESC:0 "When we lost Messenia during Thebes' invasion, we had to make do with what we had. After that painful ordeal, we must learn to make the most out of the farmland in Laconia."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_3:0 "Recruiting the Skiritai"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_3_DESC:0 "The rural Skiritai live at the border between Laconia and Arkadia, and used to be loyal subjects of Sparta. We might convince them to return to our side and become an ally once more."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_4:0 "Expanding the Infrastructure"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_4_DESC:0 "Our people were ravaged by the Thebans, threatened by the Macedonians, and have long suffered under the thumb of others. We need to rebuild our local infrastructure so it can support our bold ambitions."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_5:0 "Spartan Men"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_5_DESC:0 "Though other nations focus their efforts on creating magnificent temples, massive lighthouses, or gigantic statues, Sparta has always been the best at creating great warriors."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_6:0 "Spartan Ports"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_6_DESC:0 "To face threats in any theater of war, we will have to make sure we can assemble a navy as well as an army."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_7:0 "Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_7_DESC:0 "The worship of Artemis Orthia date back centuries, to the very foundation of Sparta itself. Her temple has fallen on hard times, reflecting the fate of our nation, and it is an insult to the both of us. It is an honor for us to be allowed to restore her domain to its former glory."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_8:0 "Fortifying Cynuria"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_8_DESC:0 "The lands of Cynuria has long been a battleground between Argive and Lacedaemonian interests; fortifying the area would secure our presence in the region."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_9:0 "Helots of Messenia"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_9_DESC:0 "The Helots of Messenia were once under rule; their independence and arrogance is an affront to Spartan interests."

 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_10_DESC:0 "With Messenia under our control, all of Laconia will finally be united under Lacedaemonian rule once more. No longer will outside threats tear down what is rightfully ours."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_11:0 "Reincorporating Messenia"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_11_DESC:0 "$spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_12_DESC$"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_12:0 "Lands of Messenia"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_12_DESC:1 "Though the city was founded to be a counterbalance to the might of Sparta by Epaminondas of Thebes, we will now use [GetProvince('(int32)431').GetName] to build upon it instead."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_13:0 "Slave Governance"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_13_DESC:0 "Helots have often been treated harshly in Sparta, leading to many rebellions and revolts. A solution to the recurring issue would let us leave our homes without fearing for their safety from our slaves."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_14:0 "Dealing with the Helots"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_14_DESC:0 "Now that we have decided on how to treat our slaves, all that remains is to enforce it in all of our lands."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_15:0 "The Path to Olympia"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_15_DESC:0 "The Eleans of Lepreon block the path from Messenia to Olympia. Under our rule, we would more freely be able to traverse the western Peloponnesus and approach the temple to Zeus in times of need."
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_final:0 "Laconian Strength"
 spartan_mission_01_laconia_task_final_DESC:0 "With all of Laconia under our rule, we have proven those who doubted the Lacedaemonians wrong. Sparta will once again become the major power of the Peloponnesus, and in time, all of Greece."

 ### Ancient Rivals ###
 spartan_mission_04_rivals:0 "Ancient Rivals"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Though we have recovered much of what was once ours, ancient rivals still loom at our borders, ready to strike at any sign of weakness."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the long history of Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, we have suffered many rivals who have looked to our lands with ambition and desire. All of them wished to become what we were always destined to be, the hegemons of Greece. The Macedonians, the Thebans, and the Athenians - outdated nations of the past."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have conquered our ancient rivals."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_1:0 "The People of Athens"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_1_DESC:0 "The city of Athens used to be one of our greatest rivals, as we were both leaders of our respective leagues. Though it is no longer the powerful antagonist it used to be, annexing their ancient capital would be an important symbolic victory for our men."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_2:0 "Taking the Long Wall"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_2_DESC:0 "We destroyed the long walls between Athens and Piraeus when we won the Peloponnesian War, but it seems they have had the audacity to have them rebuilt since then. It is time to level these fortifications once and for all."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_3:0 "Rebuilding Athens"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_3_DESC:0 "Though we must make sure Athens never rise to oppose us again, it is too important a city to not utilize its full potential. The rich farmland surrounding the city, its ancient infrastructure, and the beautiful temples. Everything should be restored to its former glory."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_4:0 "The Spartan Garrison"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_4_DESC:0 "The Athenians have often proved problematic for those who try to subjugate the city. We will establish a large garrison to make sure that will not happen again."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_5:0 "The Mysteries in Eleusis"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_5_DESC:0 "The Athenians have long offered up their worship to the goddesses Demeter and Kore in Eleusis, with a particular cult having played an important role in Athenian and Attic politics and daily life for centuries."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_6:0 "The Plains of Thessaly"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_6_DESC:0 "Thessaly was put under Macedonian control during Philip's campaign to become the hegemon of Greece. This ancient region has since cried out for liberation from the barbarian yoke, to live freely once more."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_7:0 "The Sons of Kadmos"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_7_DESC:0 "Thebes once led the coalition that dismantled the Peloponnesian League, and taught Philip II the art of war. After the destruction and restoration of Thebes, it has played a small role in regional politics, and taking it will be more of a symbolic victory than anything else."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_8:0 "Restoring the Seven Gates"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_8_DESC:0 "Until its eventual destruction at the hands of Alexander, Thebes was a powerful city-state at the center of the Boeotian League, controlling much of the regional politics between Attica to the south, Phocis to the west, and Thessaly to the north."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_9:0 "Appeasing the Gods of Boeotia"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_9_DESC:0 "Many of the deities celebrated in Boeotia are uncommon in our own lands, yet we are familiar with their names. As a show of goodwill, we will offer up donations to the sanctuaries and temples in the region."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_10:0 "Pacifying the League"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_10_DESC:0 "In the center of Greece is the ancient Boeotian League, from Orchomenos in the west to Tanagra in the east. Just as Thebes once used the League to become the hegemons of Greece, we will use it to secure control over our northern borders."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_11:0 "Ending the Macedonian Threat"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_11_DESC:0 "The barbarians of Macedon have long claimed to be of Greek stock, even as they have oppressed and annexed large parts of Greece. With our recent regional victories, it is time to put an end to the Macedonian threat and take control of the north ourselves."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_12:0 "Home of the Macedonians"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_12_DESC:0 "We will take control of the most important cities of the Macedonian region: Pella, Thessalonike, and Amphipolis. With these three cities under our control, the ancient Macedonian monarchy will finally falter and we can put an end to their voracious ambition."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_13:0 "Spartan Peace"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_13_DESC:0 "The Macedonians are used to oppressing others, now they will have to learn to live under the rule of others. Residing on the edge of the civilized world, they will be important in keeping the region under control as a bulwark against the barbarians living further north and east."
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_final:0 "Spartan Supremacy"
 spartan_mission_04_rivals_task_final_DESC:0 "We have taken back everything that was once ours, and conquered every enemy that threatened our home. With several successful campaigns behind us and an experienced army ready to follow our command, our only limit is the extent of our ambition."
