 me_subject_independence.1.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_1$: Divergent Approaches"
 me_subject_independence.1.desc:0 "The popular opinion in our nation is clear: it is our destiny to once again become an independent nation. However, how we go about this is a hotly contested topic that has led to polarizing discussions in our government. Before any dire action is taken, we must first agree on the path we must take.\n\nOne approach would be to secure sufficient resources in order to intimidate [our_overlord.GetName] into releasing us. [random_left_advisor.GetName] has come forward as a leading figure of this faction. However, as this would entail serious aggressive posturing, any failed attempts at intimidation would  definitely result in war.\n\nOthers believe the diplomatic approach where we open a dialogue with [our_overlord.GetName] to try and reach a solution that would be beneficial for both nations. [random_right_advisor.GetName] looks to be the head of this faction. But if [our_overlord.GetName] declines our proposal, what shall we do then?"
 me_subject_independence.1.a:0 "We need to seriously consider all options."
 me_subject_independence.1.at:0 "Both approaches will be discussed.\nDepending on the decisions made during this process, it will be more difficult to one path over the other moving forward."

 me_subject_independence.4.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_1$: Objection"
 me_subject_independence.4.desc:0 "One of the factions has put forth an argument that the other side fundamentally objects to."
 me_subject_independence.4.desc_l:0 "\n\n[selected_advisor.GetName] and his followers would never agree to a compromise with [our_overlord.GetName]. They have publicly objected to the argument and now [selected_advisor.GetFirstName] asks us to directly lend them support."

 me_subject_independence.6.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_1$: A Convincing Argument"
 me_subject_independence.6.desc:0 "Sounds of cheering and clapping boom through the city. One of the faction leaders has just made a rousing speech in support their argument directly to the people. I witnessed [selected_advisor.GetName] on a stand addressing the crowd with warm reception.\n\nHis argument is not perfect, however, and there are several issues that, if brought up, would surely invalidate some of his points. However, the fire with which [selected_advisor.GetFirstName] speaks is undeniable and if nothing else happens, he will surely gain popular support for his side."

Popular opinion now sways toward an #Y aggressive#! approach.\nThere are still some people who aren't content with this. [random_right_advisor.GetName] was seen sulking and stormed out after hearing the news. He will not forget this anytime soon."
 me_subject_independence.10.a:0 "Intimidation is the way forward."

 me_subject_independence.12.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_1$: Stalemate"
 me_subject_independence.12.desc:0 "After months of debate between the important members of our society, no consensus has been reached. [random_left_advisor.GetName] and [random_right_advisor.GetName] have managed to polarize both our advisors and the general populace on this issue. I will have to cut the tie and choose. Whatever I pick, someone will not be happy about it..."
 me_subject_independence.12.a:0 "The decision is mine and mine alone."

 me_subject_independence.15.desc:0 "The Great Families in [unwilling_subject.GetName] have always had great wealth and influence in our realm. On several occasions, the fate of our nation has been shaped by the whims of their ancestors. It stands to reason that we need to make sure they support our current course of action. If we find ourselves in a war with [our_overlord.GetName], we can't afford to suffer dissent or infighting on the home front. Surely we can offer them something for their loyalty?"
 me_subject_independence.15.a:0 "We will offer what we can to sway them?"
 me_subject_independence.15.at:0 "Talks will begin with the heads of important families in your nation.\nThey might ask you for something before pledging their unwavering loyalty."

 me_subject_independence.18.desc:0 "After you finished presenting your arguments to [selected_family_head.GetName], he remains quiet and appears to be lost in thought for a moment.\nFinally, he says 'I'm prepared to offer you my family's support. However, it seems some of my family's holdings have been divvied up and lost to us. We now find ourselves with too little to pass onto our children. Perhaps there are some state lands which could become available for us?' It's immediately clear to you that this was his price the moment he walked into the room."
 me_subject_independence.18.a:0 "Give [selected_family_head.GetFirstName] the holdings he is asking for."
 me_subject_independence.18.b:0 "That won't be possible."

 me_subject_independence.19.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_5a$: Minor Advisor Roles"
 me_subject_independence.19.desc:0 "During a discussion with [selected_family_head.GetName], it becomes clear rather quickly he wants some titular jobs for himself and some of his family members. They wouldn't have any actual power, but would gain prestige and influence."
 me_subject_independence.19.a:0 "Let [selected_family_head.GetName] and his brood have those token titles."

 me_subject_independence.25.desc:0 "Despite all the posturing and promises made in the past few months, the reality is we most likely can't do this by ourselves.

 me_subject_independence.30.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_7a$"
 me_subject_independence.30.desc:0 "We need to prepare for any eventuality but the costs of preparing this ultimatum are very taxing on our coffers and our populace at large. It might be prudent to ask some important men for assistance."
