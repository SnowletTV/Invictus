 syracuse_2_12:0 "Capturing Corcyra"
 syracuse_2_12_DESC:0 "#E Corcyra:#!\nAccording to myth, the island was named after the naiad Korkyra, who was taken there by Poseidon. It became a Corinthian colony in the Archaic Period, strategically positioned for trade and naval dominance over the Illyrian coast. However, Corcyra was famously rebellious, leading to one of the earliest recorded naval battles against its mother-city, Corinth, in the 7th century BCE. It played key roles in later conflicts, siding with the Greeks in the Persian Wars and acting as a major instigator of the Peloponnesian War due to its rivalry with Corinth over control of Epidamnos.\n\n#E Leucas:#!\nOriginally a rugged promontory of Acarnania, Leucas was once connected to the mainland before human intervention created an artificial canal, transforming it into an island. In Homeric times, it was known as the "Acte of the mainland," with the fortified city of Nericus. The Corinthians colonized Leucas in the 7th century BCE under Cypselus, securing control through the creation of the Dioryctus canal. It remained strategically significant, later falling under Macedonian influence, but was liberated from Cassander's garrison with the help of Corcyraean-backed forces.\n\nThe islands of Corcyra and Leucas command vital sea lanes and offer a gateway to both Greece and Italy. Yet, they lie dangerously unguarded, their defenses weak and their loyalty uncertain. The Macedonians, Epirotes, and Spartans all cast greedy eyes upon these prizes.\nWe must act before they do. By dispatching a formidable fleet, we shall remind these islands of the might of Syracuse. A swift display of naval dominance will leave them with little choice but to cow to our authority."
