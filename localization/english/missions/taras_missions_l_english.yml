taras_missions:0 "Last Ride of The Tarentines"
taras_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the late to mid 300's, Taras was dominated by the mathmetician, statesman, and Pythagorean, the wildly successful Archytas, who greatly expanded Tarentine dominance of Magna Graecia. As quickly as Taras experienced it's peak, it just as quickly began to decline.\n\nAfter the time of Archytas, Taras and the cities of Magna Graecia became increasingly threatened by the tribal Italic peoples, who made war with and encroached on Italiote land. Successive wars and local conflicts with the Messapians, Iapygians, Samnites, and Lucanians further weakened the strength and population of Taras, who came to rely on mercenary armies, or allies abroad to bail them out, such as Alexander of Epirus, who led a campaign against the Lucanians and Bruttians, at the behest of Taras. Despite these recent successes, the power of Taras has waned greatly from it's height, and the city stands as a pale reminder of once was. All while, the threat of the Roman wolf grows ever more tangible."
taras_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have defeated our enemies, the Messapians, Samnites, and Lucanians, rebuilt the city of Taras, and established our dominance over the Italiotes."
