tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south. Decide which way is forward for the valley of [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_start: "Worship Poseidon"
tayuan_ferghana_task_start_DESC: ""

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, gardens and such, to make it a more livable place.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2: "Banners Flying Over the #E Tarim#!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "Both the banners of the strange #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! foreigners who visited us and ours have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#! to our east. In order to throw ourselves in exploraiton of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must be in full control of a route to them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_3: "There Is Wine,"
tayuan_ferghana_task_3_DESC: "The rudimentary drink available in this valley, ''kumis'', mare's milk, has an absolutely horrendous taste and makes even the lowest pauper cry out for Wine @wine!, which we so skillfully produced in [GetProvince('(int32)288').GetArea.GetName].\n\nWe must ensure our survival, and introduce wine-making to the valley's slopes.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is pretty much certain that the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]s#!! are responsible for introducing wine to Ferghana."

tayuan_ferghana_task_4: "Rice, and Grain"
tayuan_ferghana_task_4_DESC: ""

tayuan_ferghana_task_5: "The Statuettes"
tayuan_ferghana_task_5_DESC: "Strange little statues of a smiling man have begun appearing in small shrines throughout, and while some claim to be apparitions of demons (especially among the local #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#!), the traders who come from the south beg to differ."

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich, and the few traders that are now reluctantly willing to make the perilous journey here have started setting up outposts along the route."

tayuan_ferghana_task_7: "A Spear, a Horse and a Bow"
tayuan_ferghana_task_7_DESC: "Telling any companion that a mixture of #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! and #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! units could be a hapy marriage would get you laughed at, if not ridiculed. Yet the regiments where these two groups cooperate are the most successful in our army, and they are notorious as well; mothers tell their children of the skill of the horse archers, and many girls swoon at the strength of the men in the phalanx.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: Zhang Qian recorded that ''The people fight with bows and spears and can shoot from horseback.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_8: "The Heavenly Horses"
tayuan_ferghana_task_8_DESC: "This"

tayuan_ferghana_task_9: "At the Head of the Refugees"

tayuan_ferghana_task_10: "Dismember the Chaosmachy"
tayuan_ferghana_task_10_DESC: "To the south, the nominal ''king'' of the Bactrians still rules over many bandits and factions attempting to ravage everything around them and leave no riches behind. We must put an end to this."

tayuan_ferghana_task_11: "Lust for the Blood-Sweaters"
tayuan_ferghana_task_11_DESC: "They keep sending emissaries to trade with us for these"

tayuan_ferghana_task_12: "Ferghani Script"
tayuan_ferghana_task_12_DESC: "#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Basis#!: The Tang-dynasty era Buddhist monk Xuanzang, in his #E Record of the Western Regions#!, reported that the peoples of the country of #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Fei-han#! (Mandarin for Ferghana) had a different script, and language, than their Sogdian cousins.\n\nUnfortunately, he also recorded that these people were ''ugly and misshapen'', which is not a great look for them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_13: "People of the Wigs"
tayuan_ferghana_task_13_DESC: "Lembrar de fazer o estilo das fortificações ser com muitas camadas paralelas e ter gado no interior, tendo quase todas as populações boas fortalezas; Mingtepa, Dawan, era a capital para os chineses, grande crescimento populacional, manors e edifícios religiosos"

tayuan_ferghana_task_14: "The Mingtepa Exchange"
tayuan_ferghana_task_14_DESC: "Many #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! flock to ''Mingtepa''', one of the valley's easternmost cities, known to us as [GetProvince('(int32)673').GetName]. There they trade with our people. Through it's markets run jewels made of jade @jade!, fineries made of silk @silk!, porcelains, and horses. This is a market of excellence and exclusivity, the first of it's kind in this long road west.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: This ''Mingtepa''' is mentioned in the #E Record of the Western Regions#! as the main city in the valley."

tayuan_ferghana_task_15: "Between the Walls"
tayuan_ferghana_task_15_DESC: "Inspired by the mountainous walls that enclose them, the people of the valley fortifies their cities in a peculiar manner.\n\nSurrounded in several rows by powerful parallel walls, the space between which was mainly populated by citizens, the inner part of the settlement was usually devoid of buildings and was intended for communal livestock."

tayuan_ferghana_task_16: "It is Ershi!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_16_DESC: "The old capital of the valley, #E Ershi#!, now named [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName] by the Greeks, has recently seen it's #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! population increase, and it is becoming a center of civilization for this previously rural population. Many among them now protest for a native administration of the city."

tayuan_ferghana_task_23: "We Are The New Nobility"
tayuan_ferghana_task_23_DESC: "And thus, having developed themselves into a propserous people, the #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! now live in palaces, own great estates, and are clad in jewelery. This new group demands equal rights to the existing nobility, and if the Greeks wish to continue benefiting from our livelihoods they must raise us to their stature in this society.

Yet with the great infrastructure being built, even the old small capital of Ershi became large Throana.\n\nToday, outside [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName]'s ekklesía, the election results were read out, and to great surprise there was a substantial Ferghani majority. It seems that the old tribesmen came to this city so familiar to them in search of the comfort of urban life, and they now wish to administrate it as their own. This local assembly already has reverted the name of the city to Ershi, and it seems that the Ferghanans of the valley now regard it as their capital."
