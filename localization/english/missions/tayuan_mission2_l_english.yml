tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley; many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things beyond these mountains.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatess of those distant places has come to interact with us at our home, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place before ignominiously ignored. If we manage to stand above the push and pull of the conflict of influences around us, from the new, mysterious East, from the native Bactrians in our lands, or the Tibetan mountains from the south, we may be on our path to greatness."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We must manage all these new outside influences in [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName] and the impacts they have on us."
tayuan_mission_2_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "May I, stand unshaken..."
