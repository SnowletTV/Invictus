tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south. Decide which way is forward for the valley of [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, gardens and such, to make it a more livable place.\n\nIt is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "Both the banners of the strange #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! foreigners who visited us and ours have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#! to our east. In order to throw ourselves in exploraiton of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must be in full control of a route to them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_5_DESC: "Strange little statues of a smiling man have begun appearing in small shrines throughout, and while some claim to be apparitions of demons (especially among the local [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]), the traders who come from the south beg to differ."

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich, and the few traders that are now reluctantly willing to make the perilous journey here have started setting up outposts along the route."

tayuan_ferghana_task_10_DESC: "To the south, the nominal ''king'' of the Bactrians still rules over many bandits and factions attempting to ravage everything around them and leave no riches behind. We must put an end to this."

(Mandarin for Ferghana) had a different script, and language, than their Sogdian cousins.\n\nUnfortunately, he also recorded that these people were ''ugly and misshapen'', which is not a great look for them."
