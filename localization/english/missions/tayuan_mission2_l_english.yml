tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south.

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, better botanical spaces and much more, to make it a more livable place.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2: "Banners Flying Over the #E Tarim#!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "The banners of many armies and expeditions have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#!, looking for things either to it's east or to it's west.\n\nSo, in order to throw ourselves against #COLOR:{0.388,0.207,0.807} Euros'#! wind in exploration of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must take control of this vital artery."

tayuan_ferghana_task_3: "There Is Wine,"
tayuan_ferghana_task_3_DESC: "The rudimentary drink available in this valley, ''kumis'', mare's milk, has an absolutely horrendous taste and makes even the lowest pauper cry out for Wine @wine!, which we so skillfully produced in [GetProvince('(int32)288').GetArea.GetName].\n\nWe must ensure our survival, and introduce wine-making to the valley's slopes.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is pretty much certain that the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]s#! are responsible for introducing wine to Ferghana; the #E Records of the Great Historian#! say that ''the regions around Tayuan make wine out of grapes, the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as ten thousand or more piculs stored away.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_5_DESC: "Strange little statues of a smiling man have begun appearing in small shrines throughout, and while some claim to be apparitions of demons (especially among the local #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#!), the odd bald men who come from the south beg to differ.\n\nPROSELYTIZING MISSION"

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich; goods no one had ever seen, more beautiful than the stars, are carried in by the few traders that now reluctantly dare to make the perilous journey here. Along the sands of the #E Tarim Basin#!, they have started setting up small outposts along the route."

Yet the regiments where these two groups cooperate are the most successful in our army, and they are notorious as well; mothers tell their children of the skill of the horse archers, and many girls swoon at the strength of the men in the phalanx.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: Zhang Qian recorded that ''The people fight with bows and spears and can shoot from horseback.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_12_DESC: "#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Basis#!: The Tang-dynasty era Buddhist monk Xuanzang, in his #E Record of the Western Regions#!, reported that the peoples of the country of #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Fei-han#!

This is a market of excellence and exclusivity, the first of it's kind in this long road west.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: This ''Mingtepa''' is mentioned in the #E Record of the Western Regions#! as the main city in the valley."

tayuan_ferghana_task_15: "Between the Walls"
tayuan_ferghana_task_15_DESC: "Inspired by the mountainous walls that enclose them, the people of the valley fortified the smaller cities of the valley in a peculiar manner:\n\n''Surrounded in several rows by powerful parallel walls, the space between which was mainly populated by citizens, the inner part of the settlement was usually devoid of buildings and was intended for communal livestock.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_16: "It is Ershi!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_16_DESC: "The old capital of the valley, #E Ershi#!, now named [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName] by the Greeks, has recently seen more and more #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#E s#!#! settle in it's walls, as it represents a center of civilization for this previously tribal population.

tayuan_ferghana_task_27_DESC: "The Eastern Empire, from what we gather, is a very advanced civilization, with many minds contributing to it's heritage and knowledge. Obtaining one of these tomes could trasmit to us great ideas that we could then use to our advantage."

tayuan_ferghana_task_28: "[GetProvince('(int32)7184').GetName] And The Jade Gate"
tayuan_ferghana_task_28_DESC: "The trading routes coming here are quite perilous; if, the #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} Huaxia#! envoys go north, they are harassed and killed by the #E Xiongnu#!, while if they go south they suffer from lack of water and fodder. Moreover, there are many places along the route where there are no cities whatsoever and they are apt to run out of provisions.\nIf we help make the journey safer, many more will be able to come through the trade route.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: The first part of the description was transliterated from the #E Records of the Great Historian#!, from a speech from an Ionian official to justify stopping trade with China, which led to the War of the Heavenly Horses."

tayuan_ferghana_task_29: "The Democratic Spirit"
tayuan_ferghana_task_29_DESC: "Distance has not changed #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! minds all that much; in the Boules and Ekklesías of our cities many are turned to a new faction, demanding the type of government we've traditionally known: democracy.\n\nMeetings in the market, parties, dinners and festivals now feature conversations demanding such a change; by the day, many more convert to this cause, as historically the tyrannies imposed in the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)305').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] did not end well for their people.
