tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south. Decide which way is forward for the valley of [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, gardens and such, to make it a more livable place.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2: "Banners Flying Over the #E Tarim#!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "Both the banners of the strange #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! foreigners who visited us and ours have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#! to our east. In order to throw ourselves in exploraiton of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must be in full control of a route to them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_3: "There Is Wine,"
tayuan_ferghana_task_3_DESC: "The rudimentary drink available in this valley, ''kumis'', mare's milk, has an absolutely horrendous taste and makes even the lowest pauper cry out for Wine @wine!, which we so skillfully produced in [GetProvince('(int32)288').GetArea.GetName].\n\nWe must ensure our survival, and introduce wine-making to the valley's slopes.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is pretty much certain that the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]s#!! are responsible for introducing wine to Ferghana."

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich, and the few traders that are now reluctantly willing to make the perilous journey here have started setting up outposts along the route."

Yet the regiments where these two groups cooperate are the most successful in our army, and they are notorious as well; mothers tell their children of the skill of the horse archers, and many girls swoon at the strength of the men in the phalanx.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: Zhang Qian recorded that ''The people fight with bows and spears and can shoot from horseback.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_15: "Between the Walls"
tayuan_ferghana_task_15_DESC: "Inspired by the mountainous walls that enclose them, the people of the valley fortifies their cities in a peculiar manner:\n\n''Surrounded in several rows by powerful parallel walls, the space between which was mainly populated by citizens, the inner part of the settlement was usually devoid of buildings and was intended for communal livestock.''"
