tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south. Decide which way is forward for the valley of [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_start_DESC: ""

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, better botanical spaces and much more, to make it a more livable place.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2: "Banners Flying Over the #E Tarim#!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "The banners of many armies and expeditions have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#!, looking for things either to it's east or to it's west.\n\nSo, in order to throw ourselves against #COLOR:{0.388,0.207,0.807} Euros'#! wind in exploration of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must take control of this vital artery."

tayuan_ferghana_task_3: "There Is Wine,"
tayuan_ferghana_task_3_DESC: "The rudimentary drink available in this valley, ''kumis'', mare's milk, has an absolutely horrendous taste and makes even the lowest pauper cry out for Wine @wine!, which we so skillfully produced in [GetProvince('(int32)288').GetArea.GetName].\n\nWe must ensure our survival, and introduce wine-making to the valley's slopes.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is pretty much certain that the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]s#! are responsible for introducing wine to Ferghana; the #E Records of the Great Historian#! say that ''the regions around Tayuan make wine out of grapes, the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as ten thousand or more piculs stored away.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_4: "Rice, and Grain"
tayuan_ferghana_task_4_DESC: "Zhang Qian reported that the people of Ta-Yuan worked the fields, growing rice and wheat. We must feed ourselves, after all, and being surrounded by bleak, desolate lands means we have to grow much of the food ourselves. After all, the #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! traveler reported that the people here numbered several hundred thousand, living in seventy cities."

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The Statuettes"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "Strange little statues of a calm, almost smiling man have begun appearing in small shrines throughout, and while some (especially the local #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#!) claim them to be apparitions of demons, the odd bald men who come from the south beg to differ."

tayuan_ferghana_task_5: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_5_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich; goods no one had ever seen, more beautiful than the stars, are carried in by the few traders that now reluctantly dare to make the perilous journey here. Along the sands of the #E Tarim Basin#!, they have started setting up small outposts along the route."

tayuan_ferghana_task_7: "A Spear, a Horse and a Bow"
tayuan_ferghana_task_7_DESC: "Telling any friend or company that a mixture of #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! and #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! units could be a hapy marriage would get you laughed at, if not ridiculed. Yet the regiments where these two groups cooperate are the most successful in our army, and they are notorious as well; mothers tell their children of the skill of the horse archers, and many girls swoon at the strength of the men in the phalanx.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: Zhang Qian recorded that ''The people fight with bows and spears and can shoot from horseback.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_8: "The Heavenly Horses"
tayuan_ferghana_task_8_DESC: "In the infinite [GetTerrainType('steppes').GetName]#E s#! and in the most inhospitable [GetTerrainType('mountain').GetName], our men celebrate their victories in brotherhood, embracing despite all cultural differences. They are a great force, a successful combination of two radically different ways of warfare, feared by the mighty and admired by the weak. \nSongs about them will be sung forever."

tayuan_ferghana_task_9: "Dawan The City"
tayuan_ferghana_task_9_DESC: "Ever since the establishment of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)6735').GetName], it has prospered with the influx of traders, artists and craftsmen from all over, willing to work together to build a great town out of what was previously nothing.\n\nWe can choose to show the city favor by sponsoring it's building projects. Then we will have a truly #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! city in the valley, far from the Macedonian influences of [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_10: "Dismember the Chaoskratia"
tayuan_ferghana_task_10_DESC: "To the south, the nominal ''king'' of the ''Bactrians'' still rules over many bandits and factions attempting to ravage everything around them and leave no riches behind. We must put an end to this."

tayuan_ferghana_task_11: "Lust for the Blood-Sweaters"
tayuan_ferghana_task_11_DESC: "The #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! Emperor is said to have grown extremely fond of our horses, and requests that we send establish trade routes eastwards so there is a constant stream of horses there.\nBy mixing the Ferghanan and Sogdian breeds of horses, we are sure to come up with faster and more agile ones."

tayuan_ferghana_task_12: "Ferghani Script"
tayuan_ferghana_task_12_DESC: "#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Basis#!: The Tang-dynasty era Buddhist monk Xuanzang, in his #E Record of the Western Regions#!, reported that the peoples of the country of #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Fei-han#! (Mandarin for Ferghana) had a different script, and language, than their Sogdian cousins.\n\nUnfortunately, he also recorded that these people were ''ugly and misshapen'', which is not a great look for them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_13: "People of the Wigs"
tayuan_ferghana_task_13_DESC: "Up in the cold mountains lies [GetProvince('(int32)6784').GetName], alone, overlooking everything around it. In the coldest months, it is custom that most of the people there use fur hats, and so among visitors they have earned the nickname of ''People of the Wigs''. If it stands loyally amongside us, we will be able to control all of the northern wastes much more easily."

tayuan_ferghana_task_14: "The Mingtepa Exchange"
tayuan_ferghana_task_14_DESC: "Many #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! flock to ''Mingtepa''', one of the valley's easternmost cities, known to us as [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName]. There they trade with our people. Through it's markets run jewels made of jade @jade!, fineries made of silk @silk!, porcelains, and horses. This is a market of excellence and exclusivity, the first of it's kind in this long road west.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: This ''Mingtepa''' is mentioned in the #E Record of the Western Regions#! as the main city in the valley."

tayuan_ferghana_task_15: "Between the Walls"
tayuan_ferghana_task_15_DESC: "Inspired by the mountainous walls that enclose them, the #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! fortified the smaller cities of the valley in a peculiar manner, quite different to anything found elsewhere:\n\n''Surrounded in several rows by powerful parallel walls, the space between which was mainly populated by citizens, the inner part of the settlement was usually devoid of buildings and was intended for communal livestock.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_16: "It is Ershi!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_16_DESC: "The old capital of the valley, #E Ershi#!, now named [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName] by the Greeks, has recently seen more and more #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#E s#!#! settle in it's walls, as it represents a center of civilization for this previously tribal population. Now a majority, many among them now protest for a native administration of the city."

tayuan_ferghana_task_17: "Help the Sogdians"
tayuan_ferghana_task_17_DESC: "Our #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]#! brothers, who we so faithfully protect ever since their demise, now hope we are the force behind their restitution. We would, indeed, benefit from this, as they would serve us even more faithfully."

tayuan_ferghana_task_18: "Colonise the West"
tayuan_ferghana_task_18_DESC: "To the West there are lands left in a barren and desolate state, surely undeserving of them, because they have been overlooked by the many who passed here. It would benefit us greatly if they were settled by our people."

tayuan_ferghana_task_19: "Elevate the Bactrians"
tayuan_ferghana_task_19_DESC: "It is unjust that our southern brothers are reduced to the substrata of their own country, our own brothers choked by [GetCulture('macedonian').GetName] villains. It is time they become free in their own homes, just as we became."

tayuan_ferghana_task_20: "New Roads South"
tayuan_ferghana_task_20_DESC: "The conquest of #E Bactria#! has provided us with many opportunities to our south, and many of our people already wish to settle there."

tayuan_ferghana_task_21: "A Great Journey in Exile"
tayuan_ferghana_task_21_DESC: "Of the #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! embassies sent east, the #E The Records of the Great Historian#! says that''Those travelling to distant lands required eight or nine years to complete their journey'', and so it meant that ''no man would complete this journey simply for his own pleasure''.\n\nEvidently, this means that the Emperor's embassies are dispatched with ''anyone who came forward, without inquiring into his background.'' This of course means that all manner of thugs and ruffians flood into our lands with the goods we need most."

tayuan_ferghana_task_22: "[GetCultureGroup('bactrian').GetName] Champions"
tayuan_ferghana_task_22_DESC: "Us #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} #E Arya#!#!, or Bactrians as they call us, have been under foreign domination for as long as we remember, either Persian, Macedonian, or Greek.\n\nNone of our own shall ever again pay tribute to foreign kings; Now the humble [GetCulture('margian').GetName] herder, the fearsome [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName] horseman and the wily [GetCulture('tocharian').GetName] trader can keep their coin, and sleep more soundly than ever, in a kingdom ruled by their brothers, in fraternity!"

tayuan_ferghana_task_23: "We Are The New Nobility"
tayuan_ferghana_task_23_DESC: "And thus, having developed themselves into a prosperous people, the #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! now live in palaces, own great estates, and are clad in jewelery. This new group among our own demands equal rights to the existing nobility, and if the Greeks wish to continue benefiting from our livelihoods they must raise us to their stature in this society. We must now be equals."

tayuan_ferghana_task_24: "Voxite or Zoroastrian?"
tayuan_ferghana_task_24_DESC: "VOXITE VS ZOROASTRIAN"

tayuan_ferghana_task_25: "Awaken the Arts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_25_DESC: "Our #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! tradition is one of #T poets#! (Homer probably was born there, and Sappho), #T architects#! (Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Temple of Athena Polias at Priene), #T sculptors#! and #T potters#!, and also great #T philosophers#! (Thales of Miletus, Anaximander of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus).\n\nOur wealth and the cultural interchange in [GetProvince('(int32)290').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] allowed for these works, and the men behind them, to think, dream and be. Surrounded by a myriad of foreign cultures, too many and too disparate to even take into account, means we boast similar conditions now; if we ensure our artists favourable conditions they are sure to shine."

tayuan_ferghana_task_28: "Carry the Road On Westwards"
tayuan_ferghana_task_28_DESC: "This new exchange of all type of goods with the Eastern Empire provides us with incredible things, and we have been able to provide them with things of our own as well.\nThe #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! traders, ever more influential in our society, regularly inquire what lies further westwards, and petition our great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] for the establishment of a route there for the flow of merchandise to continue further."

tayuan_ferghana_task_27: "The Great Treatises of the Huaxia"
tayuan_ferghana_task_27_DESC: "The Eastern Empire, from what we gather, is a very advanced civilization with many minds contributing to it's heritage and knowledge. Obtaining one of these tomes could transmit to us great ideas that we could then use to our advantage."

tayuan_ferghana_task_26: "[GetProvince('(int32)7184').GetName] And The Jade Gate"
tayuan_ferghana_task_26_DESC: "The trading routes coming here are quite perilous; if, the #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} #E Huaxia#!#! envoys go north, they are harassed and killed by the #E Xiongnu#!, while if they go south they suffer from lack of water and fodder. Moreover, there are many places along the route where there are no cities whatsoever and they are apt to run out of provisions.\nIf we help make the journey safer, many more will be able to come through the trade route.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: The first part of the description was transliterated from the #E Records of the Great Historian#!, from a speech from an Ionian official to justify stopping trade with China, which led to the War of the Heavenly Horses."

tayuan_ferghana_task_29: "The Democratic Spirit"
tayuan_ferghana_task_29_DESC: "Distance has not changed #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! minds all that much; in the Boules and Ekklesías of our cities many are turned to a new faction, demanding the type of government we've traditionally known: democracy.\n\nMeetings in the market, parties, dinners and festivals now feature conversations demanding such a change; by the day, many more convert to this cause, as historically the tyrannies imposed in the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)305').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] did not end well for their people. We must adress these demands."

tayuan_ferghana_task_30: "The Hermit of the Snowy Orchard"
tayuan_ferghana_task_30_DESC: "The wise men who came to our country seem to delight in wandering in it, spreading their teachings to the populations in return for food and provisions. Still, they do not live fully in them, and travel between towns while staying on their outskirts. They often also go out, sometimes into the mountains, for prayer.\n\nA leading #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhist#! monk tells our king that to the south, in the lands of the Indus, during the rainy season they retreat for shelter and safety from the weather, a practice called #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} 'vassa'#!. It seems here the problem is reversed; the winter months are quite unfriendly to such a lifestyle. Should we provide them with such a shelter, they would be able to continue their work."

tayuan_ferghana_task_31: "Zoroastrian Syncretism"
tayuan_ferghana_task_31_DESC: "In Central Asia, Buddhist ideas sometimes merged with Zoroastrianism or Iranian traditions. For example, the concept of Mithra (a Zoroastrian deity) was occasionally syncretized with Buddhist figures like Maitreya."

tayuan_ferghana_task_32: "Translate the Texts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_32_DESC: "The Abhidharma Pitaka texts, seven in number, are the canon of the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} #E Sarvastivada#!#! school to which most monks here belong to; this school was the first to translate the Tipitakas into Sanskrit. Translating them once again is a key step to help our populations, both #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! and #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#!, to understand and follow the path to Moksha.\n\nThey use a highly technical language, more so than usual, in an attempt to convey the ultimate truth. Translating them will require both a large investment and a collection of great minds."

tayuan_ferghana_task_33: "Syntechniai Cooperation"
tayuan_ferghana_task_33_DESC: "There is no shortage of skilled stonemasons and craftsmen now living in the valley, and because of our construction efforts just about everywhere there is no shortage of necessity for their skilled work.\n\nIf we allow them start to coordinate among them, in Syntechniai, they could work together in teams (resulting in faster and better end results), regulate their standards for quality, and pass on their knowledge more easily. They also help their members in social and religious matters, from burial funds to religious offerings and sacrifices."

tayuan_ferghana_task_34_DESC: "The revered men who wish to come to this valley to ponder, live and teach have to cross the most perilous routes, and face the harshest weathers, to bring their knowledge here; we cannot expect to be enlightened to this balance they speak of if we have no teachers to follow that way.\nControlling the southern passes grants us a direct route of communication to the rest of the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhist#! world."

Should we, cast by the wind so far away, make an effort to reach home again? Alexandros certainly managed to reach these lands. And what would we return to? We are not a warring people though, at least yet, to march across the world like him.

tayuan_ferghana_task_48: "Macedonian Petitions"
tayuan_ferghana_task_48_DESC: "In our newly conquered territories, many haven't forgotten our hostile policy towards Macedonians and their rule here. They are concerned, as they have come to live in such a remote land and it would be quite difficult to get their lives functional elsewhere. What are we going to do in regards to them?"

tayuan_ferghana_task_49: "Shipping Over All Lands"
tayuan_ferghana_task_49_DESC: "Without a doubt, one of the things that aches our #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! heart the most is the lack of access to the wide, open sea, that in it's hugeness allows the heart to fill it with whatever it wishes; hopes, dreams, and much more.\n\nGiven the recent influx of Huaxia traders, we may be able to establish ''shipping'' lanes over huge distances, which while not a real replacement is a worthwhile trading endeavour."
