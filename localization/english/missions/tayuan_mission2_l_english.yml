tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."
tayuan_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "We have been forced to interact with influences from the new, mysterious #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} East#!, from the native #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Bactrians#! in our lands, or the #COLOR:{0.81,0.15,0} Buddhists#! beyond the mountains to the south.

tayuan_ferghana_task_start_DESC: ""

tayuan_ferghana_task_1: "Refreshments For The Court"
tayuan_ferghana_task_1_DESC: "For quite a long time the city of the conqueror, [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName], has suffered from his short-sightedness, as the climate there is quite colder and harsher than in the welcoming valley. Our best architects trained in the Greek Method suggest a plethora of measures, more canals, better botanical spaces and much more, to make it a more livable place.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is worth noting that archaelogical findings in real-life point to large-scale irrigation works being built in the valley around this time."

tayuan_ferghana_task_2: "Banners Flying Over the #E Tarim#!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_2_DESC: "The banners of many armies and expeditions have had to pass through the #E Tarim Basin#!, looking for things either to it's east or to it's west.\n\nSo, in order to throw ourselves against #COLOR:{0.388,0.207,0.807} Euros'#! wind in exploration of the many lives of these Eastern peoples, we must take control of this vital artery."

tayuan_ferghana_task_3: "There Is Wine,"
tayuan_ferghana_task_3_DESC: "The rudimentary drink available in this valley, ''kumis'', mare's milk, has an absolutely horrendous taste and makes even the lowest pauper cry out for Wine @wine!, which we so skillfully produced in [GetProvince('(int32)288').GetArea.GetName].\n\nWe must ensure our survival, and introduce wine-making to the valley's slopes.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: It is pretty much certain that the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]s#! are responsible for introducing wine to Ferghana; the #E Records of the Great Historian#! say that ''the regions around Tayuan make wine out of grapes, the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as ten thousand or more piculs stored away.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_4_DESC: ""

tayuan_ferghana_task_5: "The Statuettes"
tayuan_ferghana_task_5_DESC: "Strange little statues of a smiling man have begun appearing in small shrines throughout, and while some claim to be apparitions of demons (especially among the local #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#!), the odd bald men who come from the south beg to differ.\n\nPROSELYTIZING MISSION"

tayuan_ferghana_task_6: "The First Outposts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_6_DESC: "It appears that this Eastern Empire is fabulously rich; goods no one had ever seen, more beautiful than the stars, are carried in by the few traders that now reluctantly dare to make the perilous journey here. Along the sands of the #E Tarim Basin#!, they have started setting up small outposts along the route."

tayuan_ferghana_task_7: "A Spear, a Horse and a Bow"
tayuan_ferghana_task_7_DESC: "Telling any friend or company that a mixture of #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! and #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#! units could be a hapy marriage would get you laughed at, if not ridiculed. Yet the regiments where these two groups cooperate are the most successful in our army, and they are notorious as well; mothers tell their children of the skill of the horse archers, and many girls swoon at the strength of the men in the phalanx.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: Zhang Qian recorded that ''The people fight with bows and spears and can shoot from horseback.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_8: "The Heavenly Horses"
tayuan_ferghana_task_8_DESC: "In the infinite [GetTerrainType('steppes').GetName]#E s#! and in the most inhospitable [GetTerrainType('mountain').GetName], our men celebrate their victories in brotherhood, embracing despite all cultural differences. They are a great force, a successful combination of two radically different ways of warfare, feared by the mighty and admired by the weak. \nSongs about them will be sung forever."

tayuan_ferghana_task_9: "Dawan The City"
tayuan_ferghana_task_9_DESC: "Ever since the establishment of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)6735').GetName], it has prospered with the influx of traders, artists and craftsmen from all over, willing to work together to build a great town out of what was previously nothing.\n\nWe can choose to show the city favor by sponsoring it's building projects. Then we will have a truly #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! city in the valley, far from the Macedonian influences of [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName]."

tayuan_ferghana_task_10: "Dismember the Chaosmachy"
tayuan_ferghana_task_10_DESC: "To the south, the nominal ''king'' of the Bactrians still rules over many bandits and factions attempting to ravage everything around them and leave no riches behind. We must put an end to this."

tayuan_ferghana_task_11: "Lust for the Blood-Sweaters"
tayuan_ferghana_task_11_DESC: "The #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} Huaxia#! Emperor is said to have grown extremely fond of our horses, and requests that we send establish trade routes eastwards so there is a constant stream of horses there."

tayuan_ferghana_task_12: "Ferghani Script"
tayuan_ferghana_task_12_DESC: "#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Basis#!: The Tang-dynasty era Buddhist monk Xuanzang, in his #E Record of the Western Regions#!, reported that the peoples of the country of #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} Fei-han#! (Mandarin for Ferghana) had a different script, and language, than their Sogdian cousins.\n\nUnfortunately, he also recorded that these people were ''ugly and misshapen'', which is not a great look for them."

tayuan_ferghana_task_13: "People of the Wigs"
tayuan_ferghana_task_13_DESC: "Up in the cold mountains lies [GetProvince('(int32)6784').GetName], alone, overlooking everything around it. In the coldest months, it is custom that most of the people there use fur hats, and so among visitors they have earned the nickname of ''People of the Wigs''. If it stands loyally amongside us, we will be able to control all of the northern wastes much more easily."

tayuan_ferghana_task_14: "The Mingtepa Exchange"
tayuan_ferghana_task_14_DESC: "Many #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} Huaxia#! flock to ''Mingtepa''', one of the valley's easternmost cities, known to us as [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName]. There they trade with our people. Through it's markets run jewels made of jade @jade!, fineries made of silk @silk!, porcelains, and horses. This is a market of excellence and exclusivity, the first of it's kind in this long road west.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: This ''Mingtepa''' is mentioned in the #E Record of the Western Regions#! as the main city in the valley."

tayuan_ferghana_task_15: "Between the Walls"
tayuan_ferghana_task_15_DESC: "Inspired by the mountainous walls that enclose them, the people of the valley fortified the smaller cities of the valley in a peculiar manner:\n\n''Surrounded in several rows by powerful parallel walls, the space between which was mainly populated by citizens, the inner part of the settlement was usually devoid of buildings and was intended for communal livestock.''"

tayuan_ferghana_task_16: "It is Ershi!"
tayuan_ferghana_task_16_DESC: "The old capital of the valley, #E Ershi#!, now named [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName] by the Greeks, has recently seen more and more #COLOR:{0.83,0.545,0.596} [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#E s#!#! settle in it's walls, as it represents a center of civilization for this previously tribal population. Now a majority, many among them now protest for a native administration of the city."

tayuan_ferghana_task_19_DESC: "It is unjust that our southern brothers are reduced to the substrata of their own country, our own brothers choked by [GetCulture('macedonian').GetName] villains. It is time they become free in their own homes, just as we became."

This new group among our own demands equal rights to the existing nobility, and if the Greeks wish to continue benefiting from our livelihoods they must raise us to their stature in this society. We must now be equals."

tayuan_ferghana_task_25: "Awaken the Arts"
tayuan_ferghana_task_25_DESC: "Our #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! tradition is one of #T poets#! (Homer probably was born there, and Sappho), #T architects#! (Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Temple of Athena Polias at Priene), #T sculptors#! and #T potters#!, and also great #T philosophers#! (Thales of Miletus, Anaximander of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus).\n\nOur wealth and the cultural interchange in Asia allowed for these works to be, and we boast similar conditions now; if we ensure our artists favourable conditions they are sure to shine."

tayuan_ferghana_task_28: "Carry the Road On Westwards"
tayuan_ferghana_task_28_DESC: "This new exchange of all type of goods with the Eastern Empire provides us with incredible things, and we have been able to provide them with things of our own as well.\nThe #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} Huaxia#! traders, ever more influential in our society, regularly inquire what lies further westwards, and petition our great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] for the establishment of a route there for the flow of merchandise to continue further."

tayuan_ferghana_task_27: "The Great Treatises of the Huaxia"
tayuan_ferghana_task_27_DESC: "The Eastern Empire, from what we gather, is a very advanced civilization, with many minds contributing to it's heritage and knowledge. Obtaining one of these tomes could transmit to us great ideas that we could then use to our advantage."

tayuan_ferghana_task_26: "[GetProvince('(int32)7184').GetName] And The Jade Gate"
tayuan_ferghana_task_26_DESC: "The trading routes coming here are quite perilous; if, the #COLOR:{0.768,0.498,0.09} Huaxia#! envoys go north, they are harassed and killed by the #E Xiongnu#!, while if they go south they suffer from lack of water and fodder. Moreover, there are many places along the route where there are no cities whatsoever and they are apt to run out of provisions.\nIf we help make the journey safer, many more will be able to come through the trade route.\n\n#COLOR:{0.3,0.498,0.376} Historical Note#!: The first part of the description was transliterated from the #E Records of the Great Historian#!, from a speech from an Ionian official to justify stopping trade with China, which led to the War of the Heavenly Horses."

tayuan_ferghana_task_29: "The Democratic Spirit"
tayuan_ferghana_task_29_DESC: "Distance has not changed #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! minds all that much; in the Boules and Ekklesías of our cities many are turned to a new faction, demanding the type of government we've traditionally known: democracy.\n\nMeetings in the market, parties, dinners and festivals now feature conversations demanding such a change; by the day, many more convert to this cause, as historically the tyrannies imposed in the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)305').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName] did not end well for their people.

They also help their members in social and religious matters, from burial funds to religious offerings and sacrifices."

tayuan_ferghana_task_34: "Master of the Passes"

Springing from his quarters to his scriptorium, he asks for his [GetOffice('office_master_of_the_guard').GetCulturalName(SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry)] to be summoned.\n\nHe quickly arrives and salutes him, and after a quick briefing on the situation, speaks:\n\n''I see, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]. I am no stranger to these rumours either, and have seen some strange movements myself. There are two ways we can counter them; through spying and connivery, or through visible shows of force on probable suspects meant to intimidate the rest. My men are capable of either, the decision is yours."
me_tayuan_ferghana.3001.a: "Snake them out."
me_tayuan_ferghana.3001.b: "Smite them!"
me_tayuan_ferghana.3001.a_tt: "Our success will depend on our [GetOffice('office_master_of_the_guard').GetCulturalName(SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry)]'s skill."

me_tayuan_ferghana.3002.title: "The [GetOffice('office_master_of_the_guard').GetCulturalName(SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry)] Succeeds"
me_tayuan_ferghana.3002.desc: "A few days later, [SCOPE.sCharacter('tay_bdg_plot').GetName] enters the palace's chambers, and summarily informs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that his efforts to root out the conspirators with direct action were resoundingly successful, and we already have a nice list of names, both civilian and military, in our possession.\n\nStill, the remaining conspirators plot their days away; they now hope to convince the many peoples we rule that our supposed bad governance is the source of their troubles. Such an idea is frankly preposterous, but the common man may be easily swayed by the hope of a better life, and also the idea that he, too, holds political power. Right now, we cannot do much but hope that they are happy enough with our management and won't adhere to their ideas."
me_tayuan_ferghana.3002.a: "But have we ever done anything wrong?"

me_tayuan_ferghana.3003.desc: "With a serious tone, [SCOPE.sCharacter('tay_bdg_plot').GetName] enters the palace's chambers, and summarily informs [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that his efforts to root out the conspirators with direct action failed; the ones who could wield real power are thought to have continued the plot despite our actions. Somehow, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] can't help but suspect he is a conspirator himself. For all that matters he can't do anything about it just about now.\n\nAnd so, the growing conspirators plot their days away; they now hope to convince the many peoples we rule that our supposed bad governance is the source of their troubles. Such an idea is frankly preposterous, but the common man may be easily swayed by the hope of a better life, and also the idea that he, too, holds political power.

me_tayuan_ferghana.3004.desc: "Heralds flood in from all corners of the valley and beyond; the governors, tasked with assessing if the democratic conspirators gained any real following, say that for the most part the men and women are indifferent, and seem to ignore the attempts to convince them to support the democratic cause. What good is a movement like this if it doesn't have the support of the people it claims to represent?\n[SCOPE.sChar('tay_guvnahh').GetName] personally delivers his report, and is quite happy to reveal that in some towns of his governorship, the men who were giving these speeches for democracy were actively chased away.\n\nStill, the pressure is starting to mount. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] now hears that the conspiracy is already sending people to action in the capital, all the while it seeks foreign backing, trying to get our neighbors involved. Do they wish to destroy our country, have it be subject to foreign interests? We must establish contacts first with these countries to guarantee their trust."
me_tayuan_ferghana.3004.a: "Call on our allies for help!"
me_tayuan_ferghana.3004.b: "We need our subjects' loyalty, more than ever."

The situation is agonizing, and the air weighs with the encroaching danger.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] now hears that the conspiracy is already sending people to action in the capital, all the while it seeks foreign backing, trying to get our neighbors involved.

me_tayuan_ferghana.3006.desc: "A herald arrives before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and says that he arrives from [SCOPE.sCountry('tay_allycountry').GetRuler.GetName]. He lays a cloth on the floor, opens it, and shows the court four embalmed hearts. Most of the courtesans writhe in disgust, and look away.\n\n''Here is proof of friendship between my people and yours'' he says, as he projects his arms out towards the people watching, ''these wicked tried to have us betray you, my loyal friends, and any who wishes to break such a bond will have him done thus.''. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and his advisors, convening later, weren't sure that such a radical act of loyalty was necessary, but were nonetheless thankful that the conspiracy hadn't taken it's roots elsewhere.\n\nReports still arrive of the imminence of this plot, that at any moment it can strike, so we must hope to have done enough to stop it."

me_tayuan_ferghana.3007.desc: "We have repeatedly sent messengers out to the countries we relied on, but they have been repeatedly refused entry in those palaces. Have we been so cursed as to be surrounded by packs of jackals, gnawing at the hand that offered them friendship? Must our lands be stricken with pain, it's people brutalized for something which won't change their lives so? Most won't even be citizens...\n\nRegardless, reports are increasingly arriving of the imminence of this plot, that at any moment it can strike, so we must hope to have done enough to stop it."
