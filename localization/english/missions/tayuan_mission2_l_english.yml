tayuan_mission_2: "Out From Ferghana"
tayuan_mission_2_DESCRIPTION: "There are many worlds beyond this valley, and many of those worlds vye with each other for many great things far beyond these mountains; palaces, cities, mines, rivers and riches above all those.\n\nAs we have fought for our dignity to then invest us with power, the greatnesses of those distant places have come to our homes, bringing religion, culture, wealth and trade to a place hitherto ignominiously ignored. Us, the #COLOR:{0.2,0.47,1} Ionians#! settled in this new valley home, are still very few and far between the expanses we have conquered, and the children of the first generation of our rule over these lands aren't even of age yet."

Decide which way is forward for the valley of [GetProvince('(int32)6732').GetArea.GetName]."
