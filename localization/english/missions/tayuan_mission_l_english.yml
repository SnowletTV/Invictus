tayuan_mission_1: "There, Alone Among the Youths"
tayuan_mission_1_DESCRIPTION: "Long before the novice princes of where we once called home ever set foot in these plains, we had already been led into exile here. We had long been looking inside, curbed by our solitude, but the subjugation of the plain to the south by those naive whippers of fate has forced us to stand up to them or die."

# Events

me_tayuan.1.title: "There, Alone Among the Youths"
me_tayuan.1.desc: "One does not come into this valley by accident: cradled by mountains on all sides but one, it is crossed by two rivers which in time flow into the great Jaxartes, the great northern limit for [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen], which then sprints away into place unknown. This place is the furthest both the Persians and the Macedonians ever dared come, the last hermitage before a great waste.\n\nAnd we have been relegated here. From the fair and loved cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1808').GetArea.GetName], taken, by force, by the Persian sons of evil for our daring to challenge their slavery. Many still gently weep the #E Ionian Revolt#!, our great cry for freedom. This may be a fertile valley amid desolation, but when the winds crash and the winter snow freezes the ground, that is meager compensation. Unlike the free-loaders to the south, we were taken by force from home, thousands of stadia away. It is very different."
me_tayuan.1.a: "There is no way back. We must dig in and fight."

me_tayuan.2.title: "$tayuan_task_start$"
me_tayuan.2.desc: "We have assembled an expedition under the command of a veteran captain, from [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName], named [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetName]. Him and his men, under the elegant guise of simple scribes and traders sent to simply make contact, will make contact and report to us what they have gathered from the nations around us.\n\nHaving been granted the blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and with sacrifices to #COLOR:{1,1,0.161} Apollo#! made, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] stepped onto the temple's courtyard to inspect his men. It was a cold, misty day. He had long hoped to explore these wild lands around the walled cities the Ionians inhabited, now came the time to do it and to serve the people inside them doing it.\n\nFirst, they would ride into the of the furious and rough north wind, of the god Boreas. He smiled."
me_tayuan.2.a: "A proud day for him."

me_tayuan.3.title: "The Strange Men"
me_tayuan.3.desc: "Past the harsh white mountains of [GetProvince('(int32)6788').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)6787').GetName], always coming into contact with the local [GetCulture('sakan').GetCultureGroup.GetName] tribesmen (these being scattered groups without any real organization or importance) our envoys finally reached [GetCountry('WUS').GetName]. Recognizing no real difference between the prior band of tribesmen and these, they kept on pushing north, being then chased for some distance by a patrol of the local lord. They then were led into his court, in [GetProvince('(int32)8751').GetName].\n\nInside a strangely large tent, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] was presented to [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetName], as an envoy of the greeks in the valley beyond. [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetPraenomen] smiled temptatively. Why would he do that? And all the people in the room were very strange, with wild hairs, weird hats, funny clothes... Still, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] had to find a way to try and get in their good graces."
me_tayuan.3.a: "Talk of friendship between our kings."
me_tayuan.3.b: "Talk of our great military might."
