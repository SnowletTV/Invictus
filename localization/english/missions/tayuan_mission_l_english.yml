tayuan_mission_1: "There, Alone Among the Youths"
tayuan_mission_1_DESCRIPTION: "Long before the novice princes of where we once called home ever set foot in these plains, we had already been led into exile here. We had long been looking inside, curbed by our solitude, but the subjugation of the plain to the south by those naive whippers of fate has forced us to stand up to them or die."
tayuan_mission_1_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed once we acquaint ourselves with the new situation in the area."
tayuan_mission_1_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "This valley is ours!"

# Events

me_tayuan.1.title: "There, Alone Among the Youths"
me_tayuan.1.desc: "One does not come into this valley by accident: cradled by mountains on all sides but one, it is crossed by two rivers which in time flow into the great Jaxartes, the great northern limit for [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen], which then sprints away into place unknown. This place is the furthest both the Persians and the Macedonians ever dared come, the last hermitage before a great waste.\n\nAnd we have been relegated here. From the fair and loved cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1808').GetArea.GetName], taken, by force, by the Persian sons of evil for our daring to challenge their slavery. Many still gently weep the #E Ionian Revolt#!, our great cry for freedom. This may be a fertile valley amid desolation, but when the winds crash and the winter snow freezes the ground, that is meager compensation. Unlike the free-loaders to the south, we were taken by force from home, thousands of stadia away. It is very different."
me_tayuan.1.a: "There is no way back. We must dig in and fight."

me_tayuan.2.title: "$tayuan_task_start$"
me_tayuan.2.desc: "We have assembled an expedition under the command of a veteran captain, from [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName], named [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetName]. Him and his men, under the elegant guise of simple scribes and traders sent to simply make contact, will make contact and report to us what they have gathered from the nations around us.\n\nHaving been granted the blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and with sacrifices to #COLOR:{1,1,0.161} Apollo#! made, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] stepped onto the temple's courtyard to inspect his men. It was a cold, misty day. He had long hoped to explore these wild lands around the walled cities the Ionians inhabited, now came the time to do it and to serve the people inside them doing it.\n\nFirst, they would ride into the of the furious and rough north wind, of the god #COLOR:{0.8,1,1} Boreas#!. He smiled."
me_tayuan.2.a: "A proud day for him."

me_tayuan.3.title: "The Strange Men"
me_tayuan.3.desc: "Past the harsh white mountains of [GetProvince('(int32)6788').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)6787').GetName], always coming into contact with the local [GetCulture('sakan').GetCultureGroup.GetName] tribesmen (these being scattered groups without any real organization or importance) our envoys finally reached [GetCountry('WUS').GetName]. Recognizing no real difference between the prior band of tribesmen and these, they kept on pushing north, being then chased for some distance by a patrol of the local lord. They then were led into his court, in [GetProvince('(int32)8751').GetName].\n\nInside a strangely large tent, #E [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen]#! was presented to [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetName], as an envoy of the greeks in the valley beyond. [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetPraenomen] smiled as if very entertained by this. Why would he do that? And all the people in the room were very strange, with wild hairs, weird hats, funny clothes... Still, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] had to find a way to try and get in their good graces."
me_tayuan.3.a: "Talk of friendship between our kings."
me_tayuan.3.b: "Talk of our great military might."

me_tayuan.4.title: "Sakan Indifference"
me_tayuan.4.desc: "''And as such we seek nought but respect between our lands, so as not to cause the destruction and death of our peoples.'' #E [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen]#! finished speaking, and looked to the translator, and then in time to the nomad king. ''The Sakan warriors, blessed by the golden treasures of the sky, bring war to wherever they please, including the home of your ignorant king. This is the way of our plains, and the mad butting ram who calls himself king over one of our infinite valleys ought to know better than to challenge this.''\n\nThreatening as the message seemed, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] was then shown away and led to his tent in peace. Sitting down, still unbelieving of the response, he proceded to unbelieve even more as he was invited to dine with the court. In his mind, only one thing could explain what he just lived through: to these nomads, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was just pismire ant, an afterthought. He was much too enraged to dine with these barbarians, so set off home immediately."
me_tayuan.4.a: "There are bigger powers that be here."

me_tayuan.5.title: "$tayuan_task_1$"
me_tayuan.5.desc: "The [GetCulture('sogdian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]#E s#! have, at least, one (kind of) similarity to us: they are destitute from their homeland in [GetProvince('(int32)6711').GetArea.GetName], but not entirely, as they still hold some of their original lands; it is worth noting that these were previously the wildest among them, as they lie much beyond the safety of the river #E Jaxartes#!, in wild steppe and desert.\n\nThe southern wind blew them destitute, but that, in turn, is why #COLOR:{0,0.64,0} Zephyros#!, god of the western wind, smiles upon us. Their lands may be mostly barren, but it is still the most accessible opportunity for us.\n\nThe [GetCulture('sogdian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]#E s#!, as when [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] told them were he was from, their pure curiosity from our strange complexion dropped it's innocence into a visible resentment: they too foresee a rivalry between us. Not long after entering their country, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] was, yet again, chased by a local patrol; and this time it didn't seem like he would be then led to their king."
me_tayuan.5.a: "A sad sight to see."

me_tayuan.7.title: "$tayuan_task_3$"
me_tayuan.7.desc: "[SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] sighed as he departed from his [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName] into the lands of [GetCountry('BAC').GetName]. This sorry amalgamation of warlords, profiteers and colonists has been brought by the god of the southern wind, #COLOR:{0.89,0.05,0} Notos#!, right to our doorstep. It is, for better or for worse, the biggest threat we face, a huge army thirsting after blood and spoils. [GetCharacter('(int32)24').GetPraenomen], their overlord, should be controlling them, but after talking to an old native [GetCulture('bactrian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]... companion in [GetProvince('(int32)6697').GetName] (which he knew from before the invasion), [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] quickly realises this is mostly wishful thinking, and that the huge satrapy will break free very soon. She says the court is preparing for war, and are sending a very insulting letter to the overlord very soon.\nBesides, the population, this being mostly native Bactrians, are being violently repressed everywhere to install the new Macedonian machine, and rogue armies pillage the countrysides and ask their [GetCountry('BAC').GetRuler.GetTitle] for blood.\n\nGreat troubles are sure to blow from the south."
me_tayuan.7.a: "Lest we get swept away."

me_tayuan.10.title: "$tayuan_task6$"
me_tayuan.10.desc: "Little lives in the mountain passes high above the valleys; apart from a few native communities lost between the peaks, most of the people there are our soldiers guarding these passes, which could serve an unsuspecting enemy by letting them enter the valley from our backs.\n\nSince most of the natives care little for our administration anyway, all of it has been moved to the fortress at [GetProvince('(int32)6773').GetName]"
me_tayuan.10.a: "Great!"
