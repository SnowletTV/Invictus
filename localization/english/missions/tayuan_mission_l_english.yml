tayuan_mission_1_DESCRIPTION: "Long before the novice princes of where we once called home ever set foot in these plains, we had already been led into exile here. We had long been looking inside, curbed by our solitude, but the subjugation of the plain to the south by those naive whippers of fate has forced us to stand up to them or die."

# Tasks

tayuan_task_start: "Of Boreas"
tayuan_task_start_DESC: "We must organize expeditions to better understand the polities around the valley. First, we shall send our men to the domains of the icy northern wind - Boreas."

tayuan_task_1: "By Zephyros"
tayuan_task_1_DESC: "Sweet notes ring out of Zephyros' song. The western wind is calm and blessed among his brothers. So it is for us, as out west this valley opens out onto the world."

tayuan_task_2: "By Euros"
tayuan_task_2_DESC: "Euros, the wind of the east, has ever been foretold as the bringer of bad omens. We must take the risk of upturning our fates and explore those mysterious lands to ensure our survival."

tayuan_task_3: "Unto Notos"
tayuan_task_3_DESC: "Storms travel across this world blown by the god Notos, the southern wind. He has definitely brought us quite a storm, as the Macedonians have set themselves right at our doorstep."

tayuan_task_4: "Alexandros kaí Kýros"
tayuan_task_4_DESC: "Two great conquerors have left their marks on this land: #T Alexandros#! the Macedonian Mega-Basileus who conquered the world, and #T Kýros#! (or Cyrus the Great), who, in his time, conquered the world too.\n\nThey both founded great cities in this valley - both [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName|Y] and [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName|Y] are the jewels of our lands. We must strive to honour their names and embellish them."

tayuan_task_5: "The Lost Companions"
tayuan_task_5_DESC: "Many #Y [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#! men and women sprang forth into Asia when the Macedonian armies freed them from the Persians. Whether as traders, in the armies or as settlers, their ecstasy led them into unknown lands, and with varying fortunes.\n\nMany now stand scattered and without purpose around the former empire. We desperately need their help, and they ours.\n\nThere are three options presented: one of #G 200#! @gold!, where success is practically guaranteed, one of #Y 100#! @gold! where success is slightly more likely than failure, and one of #R 30#! @gold!, where success is very unlikely."

tayuan_task_6: "Standing Over Gulka Pass"
tayuan_task_6_DESC: "Cradled as we are by the valley, the mountains still possess many passes that those who wish to wreck us can use.  Fortifying [GetProvince('(int32)6773').GetName|Y], a key gateway between most of the southern passes, will provide us great safety."

tayuan_task_7: "Fit for Living"
tayuan_task_7_DESC: "We must teach our soles every quirk of this strange land, so that we do not walk, or produce, on unknown soil. Setting up farms and plantations will go a long way on making this place livable."

tayuan_task_8: "So Long, Hestia"
tayuan_task_8_DESC: "There is no doubt that there was no other option but to stand and repel our enemies; it might not've been who we were as Ionians, but it is who we are now. This valley, our new home, will be the world's envy, and any who dare touch it will feel only despair. We stand in Ferghana."

tayuan_task_9: "A Sogdian Sorrow"
tayuan_task_9_DESC: "We have no quarrel with them, but the circumstances have forced us to face the #Y [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]s#!. Perhaps we can, once victorious, find it in our heart to show them kindness."

tayuan_task_10: "Fooling the Bactrians"
tayuan_task_10_DESC: "Our #E Epiproxenos#!, ever the master of diplomacy, has put forth a cunning plan: by posturing in the old Ionian manner, as traders and men of the arts, we can easily fool the Bactrian wolf to the south that we are no threat and that we desire to be mere traders, and we will then be able to penetrate deep into their lands."

tayuan_task_11: "Smite the Sakans"
tayuan_task_11_DESC: "The odious Sakan horsemen trample on our juvenile grass ever trying to abuse us, but a quick and decisive victory against them in battle will surely make them respect us."

tayuan_task_12: "A Guiding Star"
tayuan_task_12_DESC: "A famous artist lives in [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName], said to be a renowned metalkworker. We could comission an artwork to celebrate our new homes on the valley and inspire the hearts of all those who may want to come here too."

tayuan_task_13: "Salute the [GetCulture('tayuan').GetName]#E s#!"
tayuan_task_13_DESC: "The native tribes of the valley refuse to be made toys for us to play around with; these are their original homes, and not ours. They demand special rights above others, an offer we are practically forced to accept. Other cultures are sure to be angered."

tayuan_task_14: "Lóchos of the Jaxartes"
tayuan_task_14_DESC: "Many are requesting that we create a more organised military structure, with proper training, so that we may be able to compete with more professional armies."

tayuan_task_15: "The New Polises"
tayuan_task_15_DESC: "While to the untrained eye it might seem as if we now live in a monarchy, below the surface our conventional ruling structures of the polises are still in place, and working off each other. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] must step up to his role as a mediator between them."

tayuan_task_16: "Down the Open Plains"
tayuan_task_16_DESC: "After these early tests of strength, our army thirsts after a second challenge to their valor. Riding on against the fearsome horsemen of the east is one, as they are among the strangest, and most intimidating, enemies we face here."


# Events

me_tayuan.1.title: "There, Alone Among the Youths"
me_tayuan.1.desc: "One does not come into this valley by accident: cradled by mountains on all sides but one, it is crossed by two rivers which in time flow into the great Jaxartes, the great northern limit for [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetPraenomen], which then sprints away into place unknown. This place is the furthest both the Persians and the Macedonians ever dared come, the last hermitage before a great waste.\n\nAnd we have been relegated here. From the fair and loved cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1808').GetArea.GetName], taken, by force, by the Persian sons of evil for our daring to challenge their slavery. Many still gently weep the #E Ionian Revolt#!, our great cry for freedom. This may be a fertile valley amid desolation, but when the winds crash and the winter snow freezes the ground, that is meager compensation. Unlike the free-loaders to the south, we were taken by force from home, thousands of stadia away. It is very different."
me_tayuan.1.a: "There is no way back. We must dig in and fight."

me_tayuan.2.title: "$tayuan_task_start$"
me_tayuan.2.desc: "We have assembled an expedition under the command of a veteran captain, from [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName], named [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetName]. Him and his men, under the elegant guise of simple scribes and traders sent to make contact, will indeed communicate with the peoples around us and report what they have gathered from these countries.\n\nHaving been granted the blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and with sacrifices to #COLOR:{1,1,0.161} Apollo#! made, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] stepped onto the temple's courtyard to inspect his men. It was a cold, misty day. He had long hoped to explore these wild lands around the walled cities the Ionians inhabited, now came the time to do it and to serve the people inside them doing it.\n\nFirst, they would ride into the of the furious and rough north wind, of the god #COLOR:{0.8,1,1} Boreas#!. He smiled."
me_tayuan.2.a: "A proud day for him."

me_tayuan.3.title: "The Strange Men"
me_tayuan.3.desc: "Past the harsh white mountains of [GetProvince('(int32)6788').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)6787').GetName], always coming into contact with the local [GetCulture('sakan').GetCultureGroup.GetName] tribesmen (these being scattered groups without any real organization or importance) our envoys finally reached [GetCountry('WUS').GetName]. Recognizing no real difference between the prior band of tribesmen and these, they kept on pushing north, being then chased for some distance by a patrol of the local lord. They then were led into his court, in [GetProvince('(int32)8751').GetName].\n\nInside a strangely large tent, #E [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen]#! was presented to [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetName], as an envoy of the greeks in the valley beyond. [SCOPE.sChar('amyrgian_ruler').GetPraenomen] smiled as if very entertained by this. Why would he do that? And all the people in the room were very strange, with wild hairs, weird hats, funny clothes... Still, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] had to find a way to try and get in their good graces."
me_tayuan.3.a: "Talk of friendship between our kings."
me_tayuan.3.b: "Talk of our great military might."

me_tayuan.4.title: "Sakan Indifference"
me_tayuan.4.desc: "''And as such we seek nought but respect between our lands, so as not to cause the destruction and death of our peoples.'' #E [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen]#! finished speaking, and looked to the translator, and then in time to the nomad king. ''The Sakan warriors, blessed by the golden treasures of the sky, bring war to wherever they please, including the home of your ignorant king. This is the way of our plains, and the mad butting ram who calls himself king over one of our infinite valleys ought to know better than to challenge this.''\n\nThreatening as the message seemed, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] was then shown away and led to his tent in peace. Sitting down, still unbelieving of the response, he proceded to unbelieve even more as he was invited to dine with the court. In his mind, only one thing could explain what he just lived through: to these nomads, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was just pismire ant, an afterthought. He was much too enraged to dine with these barbarians, so set off home immediately."
me_tayuan.4.a: "There are bigger powers that be here."

me_tayuan.5.title: "$tayuan_task_1$"
me_tayuan.5.desc: "The [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]#E s#! have, at least, one (kind of) similarity to us: they are destitute from their homeland in [GetProvince('(int32)6711').GetArea.GetName]. This is not entirely, as they still hold some of their original lands; still, it is worth noting that these were previously the wildest among them, as they lie much beyond the safety of the river #E Jaxartes#!, in wild steppe and desert.\n\nThe southern wind whispered away their comfort, but that, in turn, is why #COLOR:{0,0.64,0} Zephyros#!, god of the western wind, smiles upon us. Their lands may be mostly barren, but they're still by far our weakest neighbor.\n\nThe [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]#E s#!, when [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] told them were he was from, made their pure curiosity from our strange complexion devolve it's innocence into a visible resentment: they surely foresee a rivalry between us. Not long after beggining to exit their country, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] was, yet again, chased by a local patrol; and this time it didn't seem like he would be then led to their king."
me_tayuan.5.a: "A sad sight to see."

me_tayuan.6.title: "$tayuan_task_2$"
me_tayuan.6.desc: "Many oracles earn their due by warning of the eastern wind blown forth by the god #COLOR:{0.388,0.207,0.807} Euros#!, and we certainly have lost some sleep due to it. Looking down from the valley onto the sandstone mountains that mark it's start, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] genuinely has no idea what lies beyond, save for some detestable Sakan tribesmen we'd already been told about. What if there is a distant empire just beyond, and a huge mass of men from it just ready to cross into our homes?\n\nSuch are the worries in an explorer's life; it is clearly not for everyone. The baggage train had already passed him on the journey up into the passes, so he hurried behind it."
me_tayuan.6.a: "What could lie ahead?"

me_tayuan.7.title: "$tayuan_task_3$"
me_tayuan.7.desc: "[SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] sighed as he departed from his [GetProvince('(int32)6703').GetName] into the lands of [GetCountry('BAC').GetName]. This sorry amalgamation of warlords, profiteers and colonists has been brought by the god of the southern wind, #COLOR:{0.89,0.05,0} Notos#!, right to our doorstep. It is, for better or for worse, the biggest threat we face, a huge army thirsting after blood and spoils. [GetCharacter('(int32)24').GetPraenomen], their overlord, should be controlling them, but after talking to an old native [GetCulture('bactrian').GetCultureGroup.GetName]... companion in [GetProvince('(int32)6697').GetName] (which he knew from before the invasion), [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] quickly realises this is mostly wishful thinking, and that the huge satrapy will break free very soon. She says the court is gearing up for war, whispers are abound of a scathing letter sent to the Babylonian court.\nBesides, the population, this being mostly native Bactrians, are being violently repressed everywhere to install the new Macedonian machine, and rogue armies pillage the countrysides and ask their [GetCountry('BAC').GetRuler.GetTitle] for blood.\n\nGreat troubles are sure to blow from the south. For now, our explorers shall return home."
me_tayuan.7.a: "Lest we get swept away."

me_tayuan.8.title: "$tayuan_task_4$"
me_tayuan.8.desc: "These two cities feel to us like our own two loves, secrets to everyone else that we are growing to deeply appreciate. As they are so close to each other, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuancivman').GetName] has begun devising plans to coordinate efforts between both, easing the administrative onus on them. Infrastructure has been built between in the hills between the two: the waters now extend from one to the other, from a diverted branch of  the #E Jaxartes River#!, and both cities share with each other their libraries, cities, and in the end, their cultures.\n\nSurely, those two conquerors of the past now look on with kindness from the beyond, for we are worthy custodians of their most intimate and lesser-known projects."
me_tayuan.8.a: "An enriching endeavour."

me_tayuan.9.title: "$tayuan_task_5$"
me_tayuan.9.desc: "[SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_steward').GetName] sat down, and started explaining to all at the table all the expenses necessary to properly execute the plan of convincing the [GetCulture('ionian').GetName] settlers across the former Macedonian Empire to leave their settlements and to come to our valley.\n\nNot too long into the speech, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] started feeling uneasy at the magnitude of this project. Looking out from the palace onto the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], he felt it was the right thing to do, but the sums of money being discussed weighed on his mind almost as much as the food from yesterday's banquet on his belly."
me_tayuan.9.a: "Send our finest men and messengers on to meet them."
me_tayuan.9.b: "We must make a sizeable investment to find them."
me_tayuan.9.c: "We should invest on those who are already here instead."

me_tayuan.10.title: "$tayuan_task_6$"
me_tayuan.10.desc: "Little lives in the mountain passes hidden high above the valleys; apart from a few native communities lost between the peaks that keep to themselves, most (human) activity now consists of our soldiers, stationed on our newly built fort network in the region.\n\nAlthough back home [GetCulture('ionian').GetName]#E s#! don't have much of a reputation for practicing the martial professions, the utterly inconceivable situation we have found ourselves in has already begun forcing changes into our traditional way of being. \n\nThe newly built fortress networks in [GetProvince('(int32)6773').GetName] are a thing of beauty. Atop towering gorges and amid minuscule valleys, these defenses will test the limits of any who try to cross these mountains."
me_tayuan.10.a: "Who ever cared for the #E Sogdian Rock#!?"

me_tayuan.11.title: "An Envoy From The Furthest East"
me_tayuan.11.desc: "Rumours of a great and rich empire to the east were not foreign to the ears of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but his mind dismissed them, unreachable kingdoms from the furthest reaches of #COLOR:{0.388,0.207,0.807} Euros#!. Yet, recently in [GetProvince('(int32)6737').GetName] word quickly spread of a ragged stranger, of weird complexion, claiming to be an envoy of said Empire. He said he had been made captive by the savage tribes to our east, and of a hundred men that departed with him he now only had a native interpreter to keep him company.\n\nAs these fantastical stories of far-away lands quickly spread, he was soon in audience with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], and he thus explained:\n\n''I was dispatched as an envoy of the #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! to the [GetCulture('yuezhi').GetName], but the Xiongnu blocked my way, and I have only now just managed to escape, I beg Your Highness give me some guides to show me the way. If I can reach my destination and return to make the report, the #COLOR:{0.686,0.494,0} Huaxia#! will reward you with countless gifts!''"

me_tayuan.11.b.tt: "This may #R anger#! the Eastern Empire."

me_tayuan.12.title: "$tayuan_task_8$"
me_tayuan.12.desc: "With no small effort, we have defeated all the forces that could threaten this sweet, sweet, idyllic land, which we didn't choose but were driven to, that we love no less just because of that fact.\n\nWe are all sure of one thing though: it will never be the same. As we have chosen to live here, our familiar faces will eventually give way to something not [GetCulture('ionian').GetName], and it is just a question of how much and by who our traditions get influenced. The heart sores for what was home, but smiles on with hope at this new house. We may fall, but none will say we went on without dreams, possessing the radical seed of idea in our mind. We have no choice but to see what we will, from all the new influences, become."
me_tayuan.12.a: "A new age?"

me_tayuan.13.title: "Desert?"
me_tayuan.13.desc: "Bizarrely enough, at a point up in the middle of the mountains, one doesn't come down, and it turns into a large plain, practically a desert, save some rivers and towns. The [GetCulture('sakan').GetCultureGroup.GetName] savages, well known to [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] from previous adventures, had left their ugly mark here too, but with a little persistence the men managed to reach [GetProvince('(int32)7184').GetName], an unexpectedly large city (given the desolation here), and one with a very weird blend of the Indian style and another mysterious one, with pointy black roofs and white walls.\n\nIn the streets, they found many peoples, natives and Indians and Hellenes, and one particular man, who amazed and amused us very much, of a weird complexion, pale as ourselves but with dark hair and elongated eyes. None among us could understand him, but a local trader eventually translated; he came from a certain Dsongkou, a huge, fertile land with a certain man sent from heaven to rule over it. ''And where is this land?'' asked [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen], having his worries confirmed, ''On to the East'', said the man.\n\nOver the next few days, many attempts were made to reach this fantastical Eastern land, but we didn't reach anywhere; it's as if the world ended here. We just cannot reach them."
me_tayuan.13.a: "Very intriguing..."

me_tayuan.14.title: "The Great Ionians"
me_tayuan.14.desc: "Syria, [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName], Persia, [GetProvince('(int32)3439').GetName], Egypt, [GetProvince('(int32)4976').GetName], India, [GetProvince('(int32)1883').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)4371').GetName], they flood, from the wildest countries, with weary faces but hopeful eyes, into our open arms. Many trusted only a word, a feeling, to let go of everything and chase the silhouette of a new home for the Ionian people; in the end they have found it - a serene jewel where they will live welcomed despite being in destitution!\nMany were immediately amazed with the homely climate of the valley in the midst of the brutal cold around, and are looking eagerly to us for guidance on where to settle this strange valley."
me_tayuan.14.a: "They can spread throughout the valley like seeds thrown."
me_tayuan.14.b: "We can concentrate them in [GetProvince('(int32)6735').GetName]."

me_tayuan.15.title: "Ever Lost"
me_tayuan.15.desc: "They didn't come. Despite our good efforts, many already feel too homely in their homes - despite not receiving the respect they deserve as proper Ionians, this valley is too much of a far-away dream for many, and few have chosen to undertake the perilous journey past countries and countries into our own reclusion here.\n\nStill, the few brave souls that managed to make it were welcomed with open arms. The reception prepared at [GetProvince('(int32)6704').GetName] was obviously let down with the few numbers that ended up appearing, but like the philosopher we must learn to be content with what we get."
me_tayuan.15.a: "A shame."

me_tayuan.16.title: "Hooves of Appreciation"
me_tayuan.16.desc: "We have treated the [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]#E s#! almost as brothers despite our clear superiority; they too are a people far away from home, kicked out north by foreign forces, so we could do nought but show them our kindness. This kindness was not lost on their hearts, and an emotional delegation today passed through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], thanking us for our fraternity and showering us with gifts. Our men already practice together in the fields, and we have discovered that they have the most amazing horses, capable of enduring any strain put on them. Many among us have shown themselves willing to learn these new ways of warfare on horseback, and our army is becoming quite proficient in it."

me_tayuan.17.desc: "The Great Ionian phalanx swoons victorious over the [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName] lands, but it really isn't as much of a pure phalanx as it once was - throughout our campaign, we have discovered that the people of these lands are masters of the horse, and their horses are of the finest quality.\n\nStill, this campaign has taken its toll on a people desperate for a home of their own, and robbed precisely that again - the Sogdian populations aren't happy at all."

This cavalry unit was utterly crushed, and many men who were around it are now urging their horses off into the horizon of the endless steppe, with no pride but life still in their hands.\n\nWe may have defeated the [GetCulture('sakan').GetName]#E s#!, but one lesson we have learnt from them is that in the plains around us, the wild horse used by the Sakans reigns king. We have managed to learn a bit from their masterful techniques and have incorporated them into our cavalry regiments."

me_tayuan.21.desc: "While strangers, they distrusted us, foreign kings wearing their crown over our head; the truth is that comparatively they benefit much more learning from us while we rule over them that the other way around, they're still disparate tribes like we were many years ago driving into Hellas.\n\nStill, in our civilized ways we lack the decision and fearlessness that we renounced all those years ago, so we need them just as they need us. Even more so because they know their way around the lands of the valley and those around it.\n\nAs such, we are starting to inhabit together with some degree of fraternity and compassion, and it may end up that we share the valley with them as equals."

me_tayuan.22.desc: "No one would have expected that our traditional ways of spearmen would mesh so well with the horses of the steppe, but these are some of the greatest horses available in the world, who would bleed for their riders, and as such our army is now a strange but effective hybrid between Greek warfare and Bactrian warfare.\n\nMany among the corps and on the streets have begun to call our army the ''Lóchos of the Jaxartes'', but so far it remains an unofficial name. It falls to us to decide if that is a name we wish to adopt for it."
me_tayuan.22.a: "An interesting idea."

me_tayuan.23.desc: "Political maneuvering is not work for the lesser of intellect and will. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] of the Ionians of Ferghana, if he wishes to remain in his princely condition, must anyway learn to navigate the Boules and Ekklesías of the polises of the valley, electing and deliberating on a universe of things at any given time, and form a consensus to make the valley move forward as one.\n\nIt is an awkward compromise, born from the Ionians of the valley wishing to retain their ways of living, that being democracy, but it is well known that those fell apart without much forcing; in such a hostile environment as the one we live in, individual cities would be picked apart by the vultures. If the cities want to preserve their right to assembly, the court preserves it's right to rule over them."

me_tayuan.24.desc: "Chased by the fast Sogdian horses, who some swore were sweating blood in their unbridled chase of our men, [SCOPE.sChar('tayuan_explorer').GetPraenomen] wagered that there were only two ways to proceed; either get captured and wait for ransomed, or give battle to the [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName] bandits.\n\nAs such, when the chase got near a small embankment near [GetProvince('(int32)6790').GetName], our riders reorganized and proceded to crash into the enemy riders. Inexperienced thugs, the whoresons were caught entirely by surprise, and entirely routed; sadly, some of our valiant riders perished on their saddles.\nSome time later a patrol of the Sogdian king apologised profusely, and offered our men compensaiton in gold for our losses. The king, he says, wishes to see no disagreements bubble out of thin air."
me_tayuan.24.a: "A grim picture of our situation."

me_tayuan.25.desc: "As the [GetCulture('sogdian').GetName]#E s#! no longer have a kingdom to speak of, they now look upon us almost as brothers, something of champions of their humble cause; they too are a people far away from home, kicked out north by foreign forces, so we could do nought but show them our kindness. Today, an emotional delegation today passed through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], begging us to liberate their lands and they would them have our loyalty. Our men already practice together in the fields, and we have discovered that they have the most amazing horses, capable of enduring any strain put on them. Many among us have shown themselves willing to learn these new ways of warfare on horseback, and our army is becoming quite proficient in it."
