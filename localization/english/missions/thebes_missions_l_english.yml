A bead of sweat runs down your forehead as you peer through the haze, your eyes trying to adjust to the gloom.\n\nWhen you hear the Pythia speak, a solemn intonation that sets your hair on edge, your heart falls into your stomach at her words - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will lead [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to destruction..."
