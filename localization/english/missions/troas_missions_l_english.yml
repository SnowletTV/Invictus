 me_troas.1.t:0 "The Temple of Athena Ilias"
 me_troas.1.desc:0 "Homer spoke of a great temple dedicated to Athena, atop the Acropolis of Priam, which was destroyed at the conclusion of the Trojan War. When Aeolians founded a new city on the ruins of Troy in the seventh century BC, they constructed a new temple to Athena Ilias, the patron of their city which was visited by King Xerxes of Persia and later by Alexandros the Great. Alexandros planned to expand the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world, but died before his vision could be realized.\n\nWe have corrected the errors of his heirs and made the Temple of Athena Ilias the envy of all."
