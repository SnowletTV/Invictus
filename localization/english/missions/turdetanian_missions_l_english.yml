 turdetanian_mission_01_sons_baetica_inv_DESCRIPTION: "The lands of #E Turdetania#! are full of riches. For centuries, these lands have attracted merchants from every corner of the #E Mediterranean Sea#!, especially #E Phoenicians#! and #E Greeks#! that settled here founding outposts, with some of them developing into larger settlements and even cities. This meeting point between Iberian indigenous peoples and settlers from the Eastern cultures of the Mediterranean created the #E Turdetanian#! culture. These colonies have the objective of trading and exploiting the riches of the mines and fertile lands of #E Turdetania#!.\n\n#E Turdetania#! has never been united, populated by numerous small city-states, but this will not prevent the ambitious from trying to become the hegemonic state and ruling over #E Turdetania#!. Will the city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] become the center of a unified #E Turdetania#!?"

A stone #E bridge#! provided access to the facility. On the far side, two #E towers#! welcomed the faithful, serving as both protectors and monumental features of the structure.\n\nAdvancing further, one would find a #E perimeter room#! surrounding the temple, containing 24 rooms, some of which were used as chapels. Among these, treasures of great value have been discovered.\n\nThe #E main building#! stands at the center, primarily constructed from adobe bricks and plastered in red.

Inside, a lobby grants access to the second floor, where the #E altar#! was located, as well as to a corridor leading to small rooms, which are believed to have been used for sacred prostitution.\n\nThe attribution of the temple to the Canaanite goddess #E [GetDeityDefinition('omen_astarte').GetName]#! is supported by a symbol found in the largest room of the temple, although some scholars remain uncertain about this attribution.\n\n#E Cancho Roano#! was deliberately abandoned by its builders at the beginning of the 4th century, following a great feast, and was later set on fire.

A stone path has been found here, leading to a #E staircase#! to the upper floor, made of lime mortar - one of the earliest signs of this technique being used in this part of the Mediterranean. In this courtyard, a well and a niche have been found, where the base and feet of a polychrome statue made of Pentelic marble were discovered. Scholars believe this is where the building's economic activities may have taken place.\n\nWithin the courtyard, a grotesque image was found. A great #E hecatomb#! was likely performed by its inhabitants before they abandoned the building. Among the sacrifices, horses of different origins, including Egypt and Greece, were discovered, along with other animals to a lesser extent.\n\nSurrounding the courtyard were several rooms and hallways. In one of these rooms, archaeologists uncovered pieces of what seems to be a large #E high-relief sculpture#!, marking the first human representations found at a Tartessian archaeological site. Prior to this discovery, it was believed that the Tartessians were aniconic. The high-relief appears to have been deliberately destroyed and scattered throughout the area.\n\nClimbing the staircase from the courtyard leads to the upper floor, where the #E Sacred Room#! of the building is thought to be located. Here, a bull-skin-shaped altar and remains of a large feast were found.\n\n#E Casas del Turuñuelo#! was abandoned in the 4th century, burned, and buried by its inhabitants.
