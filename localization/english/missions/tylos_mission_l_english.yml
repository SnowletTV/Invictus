 # Tylos mission tree
 tylos_missions: "Revival of Babylon"
 tylos_missions_DESCRIPTION: "On our island of #E Tylos#!, we currently walk along the razor's edge; 'protected' by the #E Seleukid Empire#!, who casts a hungry eye on our wealthy ports and gemstones, we are surrounded by aggressive Republics that would love to annex our borders. Needless to say, both friend and foe have set themselves up against us, and only time will tell if we are able to achieve a long-forgotten dream - the #E Revival of Babylon.#!"

 tylos_missions_task_12: "The Isle Of Akar"
 tylos_missions_task_12_DESC: "Perhaps we might go about purchasing some lands from the #E Seleukid Empire#!? Their holdings are so vast that they might be willing to part with two small islands, especially if the price is right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 tylos_missions_task_13_DESC: "The time is at hand to see if we can seize the #E Straight of Hormizad#! by any means possible. Although we prefer a diplomatic solution, going to war is not out of the question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"

 tylos_missions_task_24_DESC: "The prime location of [GetProvince('(int32)7210').GetName] is begging for infrastructural improvements, and for obvious reasons; this province controls the Strait that leads into the Sinus Persicus, making it supremely important. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"

 me_tylos_1_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the Sages and Seers of [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetName] must have peered deeply into the future through the Fabric of the Stars, and surely they knew of the foretold hour of their destruction at the hands of #E Cyrus#! - the nadir of its long and rich history.\n\nYet there must have been consolation, as well, in the knowledge that all would not be lost forever, but that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would forge anew what had been broken and lost so long ago. It brings the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] joy to see the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] assume [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rightful place on the throne of Babylon."
 me_tylos_1.a: "Babylon has risen again!"
 me_tylos_1.b: "None of this would have ever happened without Tylos!"
 
 me_tylos_2_title: "A Rich Memory"
 me_tylos_2_desc: "In days of old, it is said that the Babylonian people were guided in their affairs by a powerful bureaucracy, one that was able to effectively adminster government while maintaining the blessings of the gods. There was a central figure known as the #E Lugal#! that ruled like a King would, assigning important tasks to deputies and advisors.\n\nNow that we have reformed the ancient nation of #E Tilmun#!, claiming by rights the authority and gravitas of that long-gone state, it has been proposed that we go one step further and actually adopt the #E Babylon Bureaucracy#! as our own manner of governance.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has argued that this will only bring legitimacy to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and shall do wonders to increase our international prestige, yet others claim this is a monarchy in all but name."
 me_tylos_2.a: "We believe in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!"
 me_tylos_2.b: "The current system always worked..."
 
 me_tylos_3_title: "The Memory Of Babylon"
 me_tylos_3_desc: "For many years now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been guided by a singular vision - reclaiming the glory of #E Babylon#! for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, and this includes driving the invaders out of the city itself and purifying it in a series of rituals.\n\nNow that we stand in a position to act upon our impulses, all that remains to be determined is how far our levies will have to go."
 me_tylos_3_i_tt: "We gained claims on the [GetProvince('(int32)918').GetState.GetName]"

 me_tylos_3.b: "Just Babylon for now..."
 
 me_tylos.4.t: "The Three Temples"
 me_tylos.4.desc: "A most fortuitous discovery! While we were busy constructing our Grand Theater in [GetProvince('(int32)7202').GetName], our diggers uncovered what appeared to be a section of an old, abandoned temple. Greatly excited by this, the excavations continued, and not one but three small structures were eventually unearthed in the heart of the city.\n\nWhile the center of Tylos was always considered to be among the most valuable real estate in our entire nation, there has been a mad dash amongst the nobility and the well-off [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizens to buy properties near the excavation site. We will one day restore the Three Temples to their true glory - what a gift from the gods!\n\nOne pleasant outcome of this entire experience is that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has become fast friends with our [GetOffice('office_pontifex').GetCulturalName(SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry)], thanks to the many hours that the two have spent together observing this excavation."

 me_tylos.6.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], now that the holy site for #E Awal#! has been built and beautified with a gigantic cult statue of the shark god, it is said that wonderful and inexplicable things are happening in our city. It seems that Awal sees what we have done and is pleased by our efforts.\n\nRecently, a strange priest that calls himself '#E The Shark#!' has appeared in the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], preaching and prophesying in the streets that a golden age awaits our people.\n\nThis man, who some believe to be mad but others say is blessed by Awal, has boldly offered his services to the nation if we are willing to make a generous offering to Awal."

 me_tylos.7.desc: "Now that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has a proper library and academy, we can begin researching things that are of interest to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people in earnest - all thanks to the handiwork of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\nEven though the might of ancient nation of #E Tilmun#! has long faded from the earth, memory of its glory has not faded from the hearts of our kinsmen, who believe our stories are somehow connected.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has asked our scholars to research anything and everything that we have access to, hoping that we can find some evidence of this old kingdom somewhere."
 me_tylos.7.a: "I eagerly await the results of what these scholars discover"
 
 me_tylos.8.t: "A Memory Of Tilmun:Conclusion"
 me_tylos.8.desc: "A year to the day, it has been reported that our scholars have completed their efforts into researching the history of #E Tilmun#!, that ancient trading power that once controlled this area thousands of years ago.\n\nOur noble classes were thorough in their inquiries, purchasing scrolls of great antiquity for our library and often sending expeditions to various regions in hopes of discovering more clues about Tilmun.\n\nImagine the surprise on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s face when our researchers told [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] that they had found a direct connection between our nation and their own, and that by rights of conquest, we could take these forgotten homelands for ourselves."
 me_tylos.8.a: "This is an interesting development, to say the least..."
 me_tylos.8_tt: "The mission task '#Y A Memory Of Tilmun#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 
 me_tylos.9.t: "Exporting Babylonian Canes"
 me_tylos.9.desc: "Thanks to the foundry and the marketplaces in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], we are manufacturing luxury goods at a staggering rate and selling our entire inventories at shocking prices - we are truly seeing profits that were unimaginable before.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is not the only person to recognize the exciting business climate; a Tylian nobleman named #E Ea-Nasir#! has also been very active with trade, and the #E Babylonian canes#! that his workshops produce are desired by the upper classes the world over.\n\nPerhaps we could hire the services of such a nobleman? It will set us back a pretty penny, but can one place a monetary value on such things?"
 me_tylos.9.a: "We must have Ea-Nasir and his expertise!"
 me_tylos.9.b: "I don't have a good feeling about this..."
 me_tylos.9_tt: "The mission task '#Y Exporting Babylonian Canes#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 
 me_tylos.10.t: "The Mesopotamian-Indian Trade"
