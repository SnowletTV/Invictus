 # Mission Tasks
 ####################
 umbria_mission_01_DESCRIPTION: "Locked away in the Hills of the Apennine range, the Umbrian tribes have long been a remote, rural people. Though we have occasionally allied against allied threats, it has generally been up to individual tribes or settlements to engage in skirmishes with outsiders, such as the antagonistic Etruscan cities.\n Now though, a #E militaristic state emerges#! from the Latin lowlands to our Southwest. \nIn these uncertain circumstances, the Umbrian tribes have once again joined under a grand alliance, united to extend our own will across the region. \n\n#E Let us cast down our threats, so that we, the Umbrians, may claim hegemony over Italia!#!"
 umbria_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be complete when Umbria has freed the #E Italic#! tribes from the Latin yoke, and consolidated #E Italia#! into a single Umbrian #E Federation#!!"
 umbria_mission_01_REWARD_DESCRIPTION: ""
 umbria_mission_task_1_DESC: "The Umbrians have long had an antagonistic relationship with the Etrurian cities. However, with greater threats emerging for both our peoples, it is time to decide whether we will continue to squabble, or if we will finally put aside our differences for our mutual benefit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 umbria_mission_task_2_DESC: "Although we do not always see eye to eye with everything, are the Etruscans truly that bad? Especially when compared to some of the alternatives...perhaps it is best for the both of us if we seek a policy of friendship and cooperation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"
 umbria_mission_task_3_DESC: "With our growing economic connections drawing our people closer by the day, we are happy to pursue trade with our neighbors, the Etruscans, for the benefits are too numerous to count. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 umbria_mission_task_4_DESC: "The time has come for Etruria to honor their oaths and to join us in glorious battle - the day has come where our combined forces shall humble the Roman wolf once and for all! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil20!"
 umbria_mission_task_5_DESC: "We cannot coexist with the Etruscans to the west, and we shall take advantage of their infighting and bickering to pounce on their cities when they least expect it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil15!"
 umbria_mission_task_6_DESC: "Now that we have smashed all Etruscan resistance to our rule, let us command our newest subjects to open up their coffers and treasuries - war is expensive, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has many bills that need to paid. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil2!"
 umbria_mission_task_7_DESC: "In a cruel twist of fate, the gods have seen fit to give us the power of life and death over the Etruscans - it remains up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to see if the full ire of our vengance will be brought upon them. Will we finally have revenge over settlements and lands once lost? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil5!"
 umbria_mission_task_8_DESC: "With the core Etruscan lands firmly within our grasp, our attention has focused on the west, where the islands of #E Sardinia#! and #E Corsica#! call out to our forces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"
 umbria_mission_task_9_DESC: "Although [GetProvince('(int32)23').GetName] was once a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] possession, over the years, it has been taken over by the #E Sabines#! - but no more! Now that we are in a position of strength, we must demand that this territory be given back to us, its rightful owners. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil21!"
 umbria_mission_task_10_DESC: "If we are careful with how we proceed, then there is a good chance that we could persuade Rome's feudatories to abandon their oaths of fealty and join our cause. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil18!"
 umbria_mission_task_11_DESC: "We must not abandon our conquests against the Romans, but shall pursue them deeper and deeper into their provinces - Capua must be ours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"
 umbria_mission_task_12_DESC: "Capua is finally ours, and there is enough political will within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to see the Romans destroyed entirely...we must press on until the deed is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil4!"
 umbria_mission_task_13_DESC: "The cities of $PIE$ are filled with industrious people that yearn for friendship and brotherhood with our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kinsmen. It benefits both of our nations for us to draw closer together in these perilous times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil24!"
 umbria_mission_task_14_DESC: "How wise are the leaders of $PIE$? Do they know a golden opportunity when they see one, and will they choose the path of wisdom when they come to a crossroads? We hope, for the sake of the continued harmony between our nations, that they understand the gravity of our request. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil8!"
 umbria_mission_task_15_DESC: "Thanks to the steady flow of Umbrian goods headed towards to port cities of the Picene coast, our economy has never been better and only continues to grow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil9!"
 umbria_mission_task_16_DESC: "The small city of [GetProvince('(int32)117').GetName] finds itself surrounded by hostile powers but believes that they will remain untouched by the wars that are changing the face of all Italia. It is time to show them how very wrong they are. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil29!"
 umbria_mission_task_17_DESC: "There are many Gaulish tribes in the north and we are unsure how to view them - are they potential partners for peace and prosperity, or yet another foe that could bring destruction to the walls of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]? We must decide how we are going to deal with these barbarians, and we cannot afford to make a poor choice - this could be a matter of life or death. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"
 umbria_mission_task_18_DESC: "One of the greatest threats that we face is not from the south, but rather from our northern border - we have heard far too many tales about rampaging barbarian hordes spilling forth from the mountain passes. If we want to sleep easily at night, then it is best that we secure the northern border. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"
 umbria_mission_task_19_DESC: "Victory calls to our forces, who have secured the mouth of the #E Padus River#! for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] - press foward and head towards the mountains! Show no mercies to the Gauls foolish enough to stand and fight! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil2!"
 umbria_mission_task_20_DESC: "The #E Samnites#! believe that they are better than our us, with their diplomats going as far as to suggest that their levies would have the better of ours if it ever came down to war between our nations. Has the time come to humble these loud-talking hill dwellers once and for all, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"
 umbria_mission_task_21_DESC: "With our most powerful rivals for Italia utterly destroyed, we hereby proclaim ourselves to be the #E Hegemon#! of this land - send riders to the capitals not yet under our sway and inform them that their days are numbered! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"
 umbria_mission_task_22_DESC: "Our blacksmiths and metalworkers are known to be masters of their craft, with merchants from all across #E Italia#! traveling to the markets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in order to obtain our finely-wrought trinkets and items for themselves. Let us further encourage #E Umbrian#! metalworking by investing into its largest centers near Tuder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"
 umbria_mission_task_23_DESC: "In order to ensure the stability of our economy and the quality of our specie, we must construct a mint in [GetProvince('(int32)123').GetName] that will produce coinage that is up to our standards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
 umbria_mission_task_24_DESC: "We should not only grow our cities with buildings, but should be mindful that our hinterlands are also worth developing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil1!"
 umbria_mission_task_25_DESC: "Let us send word to our Greek friends that we seek more formal agreements outside of what we currently enjoy. Perhaps, if we are lucky, we shall find ourselves allies that are willing to fight and triumph with us in our hour of need. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil19!"
 umbria_mission_task_26_DESC: "We are pushing southward, with the calm waters of the #E Mare Ionium#! becoming visible in the distance - this is a good region, and one that we should conquer for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil25!"
 umbria_mission_task_27_DESC: "While our levies never tire of battle, perhaps we could sway $BRT$ to join with us diplomatically...for how could they hope to stand against us? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil13!"
 umbria_mission_task_28_DESC: "This is a momentous day for our people, one in which the proper methods of worshipping mighty #E Jupiter#! shall be written on bronze tablets for all posterity to cherish! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"
