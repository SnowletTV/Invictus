me_vasconian_17_desc: "The gathering of the Tribal Chiefs has concluded in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and after all of the deliberations were heard, the matter boiled down to two choices; peace or war.\n\nWe could try to flex our diplomatic muscles by sending envoys, to see if they are interested in becoming a feudatory. Of course, there are plenty within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] tribes who want to send our warriors into the Vardulian settlements. The deciding vote must be made by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."
me_vasconian_17.a: "Pursuing peaceful means is never a bad thing, is it?"
me_vasconian_17.b: "Our levies could use the fighting experience...it must be war"

me_vasconian_18_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic"
me_vasconian_18_desc: "Now that we have made up our minds to pursue peace with the Vardulians, we have gathered an embassy in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. We will load up our diplomats with fine [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] goods, make the proper sacrifices, and then send them to the lands of our neighbors.\n\nWe hope that they will return with some exciting news, but everything is in the hands of the gods now. "
me_vasconian_18.a: "We anxiously await their answer..."
me_vasconian_18.b: "We anxiously await their answer..."
me_vasconian_18.c: "We anxiously await their answer..."

me_vasconian_19_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic"
me_vasconian_19_desc: "The #E Vardulians#! need to learn how to control their tongues better, because if they are not careful, then their boastful mouths might get them into trouble.\n\nThey have insulted our diplomats, hurling abuse at our poor men and threatening their lives - needless to say, we don't see them submitting to us any time soon."
me_vasconian_19.a: "Then it must be war!"

me_vasconian_20_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
me_vasconian_20_desc: "The #E Vardulians#! have entertained our words and have agreed to what we have asked of them - they will become our feudatory, and have thrown a feast in their capital of [GetProvince('(int32)1083').GetName] in order to celebrate the occasion."

me_vasconian_21_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic"

Although any threats have been unsaid, we have the impression that this is a mere formality on their end - if we do not agree to their slavery, then they will undoubtedly try to force the yoke upon us...we need to be careful."
me_vasconian_21.a: "Why would we submit to a tribe that is weaker than us?"
me_vasconian_21.b: "Do we really want war? Let's agree to what they are saying"

me_vasconian_22_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
me_vasconian_22_desc: "The Vardulians have responded to our proposal, and rather churlishly at that - it has become abundantly clear that not only do they not wish to be our feudatory, but they have no interest in even maintaining friendly relations with us.\n\nIt won't be long until our forces meet again..."
me_vasconian_22.a: "We are going to bury them!"
vasconian_task_22_tt: "We will get a claim on every owned province of #Y [GetCountry('VAD').GetName]#!"

me_vasconian_23_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
me_vasconian_23_desc: "Excellent news from [GetProvince('(int32)1083').GetName]! The cowardly Vardulians have weighed their options and have decided a lifetime of servitude is better than dying at the hands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies - they will become our feudatory!"

me_vasconian_24.b: "They must pursue closer ties with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]"

me_vasconian_25_title: "The Mountain People"
me_vasconian_25_desc: "The tribes living in the mountain have sent their thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], reaffirming their oaths of loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and promising to assist the nation if their help is needed.\n\nWhile some are lamenting the lost opportunity to draw the mountain people closer, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is totally at peace with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] decision."
me_vasconian_25.a: "The mountain people are loyal, and that's all I care about"

me_vasconian_26_title: "The Mountain People"
me_vasconian_26_desc: "The commands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] were stoically received by the tribes living in the mountain, who have agreed to end their isolation and to embrace a national [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] identity. Their communities are opening up to outsiders, and travelers from [GetProvince('(int32)1016').GetName] are frequently making the journey into the highlands.\n\nThis has been a stunning victory for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who has drawn our kinsmen closer together - the social fabric of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has never been woven tighter."
me_vasconian_26.a: "We are one people, one nation...under my rule"

#### Raiding Icetania ####

me_vasconian_27_title: "Raiding Icetania"
me_vasconian_27_desc: "Our scouts are reporting that Icetanian levies are on the move! It seems that they are hoping to launch a cattle raid on our territory, but their soldiers are heavily armed and could be launching an invasion.\n\nWe must gather our forces and muster our defenses!"
me_vasconian_27.a: "Tell the boys to get ready for battle and send them out immediately"

me_vasconian_28_title: "Raiding Icetania"
me_vasconian_28_desc: "After a few days of tracking, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies have managed to hunt down the Icetanian raiding party, and their numbers are staggering - they easily outnumber our forces four to one.\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming odds, there are some in camp who are begging [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to offer peace terms, but others view this as weakness and want to launch an attack."
me_vasconian_28.a: "Our hands are tied...we must negotiate"
me_vasconian_28.b: "We must strike now while we have the element of surprise!"

me_vasconian_29_title: "Raiding Icetania"

me_vasconian_30_title: "Raiding Icetania"
me_vasconian_30_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] face and body covered with woad, is at the front of our levies, creeping silently through underbrush towards the camp of the Icetanian raiders.\n\nWithin moments, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldiers will pounce on the unsuspecting barbarians! "
me_vasconian_30.a: "I am confident in our total victory over these barbarians"

me_vasconian_31_title: "Raiding Icetania:Final"
me_vasconian_31_desc: "In a curious development, the Icetanian raiders have refused our gifts, asking instead that we accept them into our territories as vassals.\n\nIt seems that some political instability amongst their Chieftains had caused a branch of their tribe to abandon their homelands, and our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] scouts mistakenly thought that they were coming to attack our territory.\n\nWhile some are unhappy that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has extended an olive branch to these foreigners, no one can deny that no blood was shed and that our numbers have swollen."
me_vasconian_31.a: "I will always pursue peace first - I care not what others say"

me_vasconian_32_title: "Raiding Icetania:Final"
me_vasconian_32_desc: "Although the battle was fiercely contested by the Icetanians, and indeed, there were moments when it seemed that the raiders would gain the upper hand, our forces were able to secure victory, albeit it at a great cost.\n\nNevertheless, a win is a win, and all are in awe of the martial prowess of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who is able to vanquish forces larger than our own."

me_vasconian_33_desc: "Some of the nobility have approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and have asked the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] to set aside some funds for the construction of a library.\n\nAs our power and status grwos, so too has our bureaucracy, and the upper classes want to ensure that we have a place to store records of business transactions."
me_vasconian_33.a: "I agree with this idea - sure"
me_vasconian_33.b: "No, I don't see the point"

me_vasconian_34_title: "Chief City Of The Vascones:Market"
me_vasconian_34_desc: "Feeling emboldened by their successful request, the nobles have gingerly approached our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] with a humble request - does [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have the funds to build a marketplace as well?"
me_vasconian_34.a: "What a splendid idea - I'm surprised I didn't think of it myself"
me_vasconian_34.b: "Unfortunately, we do not have the money right now"

me_vasconian_35_title: "Chief City Of The Vascones:Market"
me_vasconian_35_desc: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] did not agree to fund a library, this has not stopped our nobles from pressing their luck - this time, they are wondering if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] could set aside funds for a new marketplace."

me_vasconian_36_desc: "It seems that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] nobility believes that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has endless pockets, for now they have sent a message to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], wondering if there is the possiblity that a forum could be built in [GetProvince('(int32)1078').GetName]."
me_vasconian_36.a: "A splendid idea - here is the money, now make it happen"
me_vasconian_36.b: "Sorry, but I don't have the budget for this"

me_vasconian_37_title: "Chief City Of The Vascones:Forum"
me_vasconian_37_desc: "Eternal optimists, our nobles have once again asked [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to spare some coin for [GetProvince('(int32)1078').GetName], this time in order to construct a forum. Our people have been congregating in the center of town anyways, and a proper facility would be a boon to its inhabitants."
me_vasconian_37.a: "They have worn me down...tell them I said yes"
me_vasconian_37.b: "I will eventually build a forum, but for now, the answer is no"

me_vasconian_38_desc: "Now that construction in [GetProvince('(int32)1078').GetName] has finally drawn to its close, the city is quickly becoming known as the chief city of the Vascones, surpassing even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in certain aspects.\n\nVisitors to Pompelo are often flabbergasted when they enter the city gates, believing themselves to be in one of the ancient cities of #E Greece#! and not a recently constructed town in the Vasconian hills."
me_vasconian_38.a: "I have done a magnificent thing for my people..."

#### Identity of the Barscunes ####

me_vasconian_39_title: "Identity Of The Barscunes"
me_vasconian_39_desc: "A few moments later, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is people watching in the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] when a curious sight stops the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] dead in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tracks.\n\nLeaning against a wall, a beggar woman is sleeping while sitting upright, a wrinkled hand holding a small wooden cup in hopes of alms. Next to her, a small child is playing in the dirt, using sticks as makeshift toys and humming a soft tune. It is clear they have nothing, and yet they seem happy.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] suddenly feels a pang in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] chest and is filled with emotion. Dropping a gold coin into the beggar's bowl, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] walks away silently, unable to forget the image of the playing child."
me_vasconian_39.a: "Do I even remember what it was like to be that innocent?"

me_vasconian_40_title: "Identity Of The Barscunes"
me_vasconian_40_desc: "Feeling an inexplicable lump growing in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] throat, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] continues walking through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. There is laughter coming from an alleyway, and the smells of cooking pottage causes [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s stomach to growl.\n\nDucking into the small tavern, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] pays a few copper coins and sits at a table, eating the simple stew and drinking watered-down wine while listening to the conversations around [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim].\n\nMuch to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] surprise, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] realizes that these people are not Vasconian, but are Aquitanian - their accents give it away.\n\nCuriously, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] realizes that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has never met an Aquitanian in real life. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] finishes [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] meal in agreeable silence, enjoying the friendly chatter inside the shop."
me_vasconian_40.a: "Why haven't I ever done this before?"

me_vasconian_41_title: "Identity Of The Barscunes:Final"
me_vasconian_41_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] returns home later that evening, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind filled with all of the sights and sounds of the day. Despite being exhausted, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] cannot stop thinking about the Barscunes, and how similar they are to our own people, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s.\n\nA thought enters [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind..."
me_vasconian_41.a: "I should invite more Aquitanians to our nation, for they are good people"
me_vasconian_41.b: "I admire the Barscune culture but I am proud to be Vasconian"

#### The True Lords of the Ebro ####

me_vasconian_42_title: "The True Lords Of The Ebro"
me_vasconian_42_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the people of the #E Ilergetia#! region feel neglected and overruled by us Vasconians, and they accuse us of wanting to dominate the lands of our neighbors without allowing anyone to share in the natural wealth of the land.\n\nThis potentially could be a problem if we do not do something about it..."
me_vasconian_42.a: "Do what we can to assuage their feelings"
me_vasconian_42.b: "I will not be intimidated by these fools"

me_vasconian_43_title: "The True Lords Of The Ebro"
me_vasconian_43_desc: "Although this is frustrating to hear, the #E Ilergetians#! reject the offers that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have made to them, claiming that is an insult and nowhere near enough.\n\nWe will have one more chance to settle this matter peacefully."
me_vasconian_43.a: "Ugh, fine - send them something else"
me_vasconian_43.b: "We have already given them everything that I am willing to"

me_vasconian_44_title: "The True Lords of the Ebro:Final"
me_vasconian_44_desc: "Unbelievable! The treacherous #E Ilergetians#! to the east have declared their independence from us and are marching on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]! We will have to subdue them in the field or else all will be lost!"
me_vasconian_44.a: "We will show them no mercy!"

#### The Ebro Confederation ####

me_vasconian_45_desc: "Now that the elites of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society have gathered near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has ordered that everyone wait for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] in the fortress.\n\nTonight, all will finally be revealed."
me_vasconian_45.a: "I shall give a speech soon..."

me_vasconian_46_title: "The Ebro Confederation"
me_vasconian_46_desc: "'[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is dead.' The words of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] hang heavily in the air, sending shocked gasps throughout the assembly.\n\n'Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, our country has been transformed into something that is greater than it was before.' Turning to the wisened heads gathered in the room, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice rising to a crescendo, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] raises a triumphant fist towards the sky.\n\n'I call you here to announce our greatest hour - in order to ensure the security and continuing stability of our people, the dream of #E Vasconia#! will be reorganized into the a Tribal Confederation!'\n\nAs bodyguards come to stand behind [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the speech continues. 'We will defend our borders by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies, and will stand together, united against attacks from within or without. Let our enemies take heed; those who challenge our resolve will be crushed.'"
me_vasconian_46.a: "All hail the #E Ebro Confederation#!!"
