 me_vasconian_17_desc: "The gathering of the Tribal Chiefs has concluded in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and after all of the deliberations were heard, the matter boiled down to two choices; peace or war.\n\nWe could try to flex our diplomatic muscles by sending envoys, to see if they are interested in becoming a feudatory. Of course, there are plenty within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] tribes who want to send our warriors into the Vardulian settlements. The deciding vote must be made by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."
 me_vasconian_17.a: "Pursuing peaceful means is never a bad thing, is it?"

 me_vasconian_18_desc: "Now that we have made up our minds to pursue peace with the Vardulians, we have gathered an embassy in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].

 me_vasconian_19_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic"
 me_vasconian_19_desc: "The #E Vardulians#! need to learn how to control their tongues better, because if they are not careful, then their boastful mouths might get them into trouble.\n\nThey have insulted our diplomats, hurling abuse at our poor men and threatening their lives - needless to say, we don't see them submitting to us any time soon."
 me_vasconian_19.a: "Then it must be war!"
 
 me_vasconian_20_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
 me_vasconian_20_desc: "The #E Vardulians#! have entertained our words and have agreed to what we have asked of them - they will become our feudatory, and have thrown a feast in their capital of [GetProvince('(int32)1083').GetName] in order to celebrate the occasion."

Although any threats have been unsaid, we have the impression that this is a mere formality on their end - if we do not agree to their slavery, then they will undoubtedly try to force the yoke upon us...we need to be careful."
 me_vasconian_21.a: "Why would we submit to a tribe that is weaker than us?"
 me_vasconian_21.b: "Do we really want war? Let's agree to what they are saying"
 
 me_vasconian_22_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
 me_vasconian_22_desc: "The Vardulians have responded to our proposal, and rather churlishly at that - it has become abundantly clear that not only do they not wish to be our feudatory, but they have no interest in even maintaining friendly relations with us.\n\nIt won't be long until our forces meet again..."
 me_vasconian_22.a: "We are going to bury them!"
 vasconian_task_22_tt: "We will get a claim on every owned province of #Y [GetCountry('VAD').GetName]#!"
 
 me_vasconian_23_title: "Setting Sights On The Atlantic:Final"
 me_vasconian_23_desc: "Excellent news from [GetProvince('(int32)1083').GetName]! The cowardly Vardulians have weighed their options and have decided a lifetime of servitude is better than dying at the hands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies - they will become our feudatory!"

 me_vasconian_25_title: "The Mountain People"
 me_vasconian_25_desc: "The tribes living in the mountain have sent their thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], reaffirming their oaths of loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and promising to assist the nation if their help is needed.\n\nWhile some are lamenting the lost opportunity to draw the mountain people closer, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is totally at peace with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] decision."
 me_vasconian_25.a: "The mountain people are loyal, and that's all I care about"
 
 me_vasconian_26_title: "The Mountain People"
 me_vasconian_26_desc: "The commands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] were stoically received by the tribes living in the mountain, who have agreed to end their isolation and to embrace a national [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] identity. Their communities are opening up to outsiders, and travelers from [GetProvince('(int32)1016').GetName] are frequently making the journey into the highlands.\n\nThis has been a stunning victory for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who has drawn our kinsmen closer together - the social fabric of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has never been woven tighter."
 me_vasconian_26.a: "We are one people, one nation...under my rule"

 me_vasconian_28_title: "Raiding Icetania"
 me_vasconian_28_desc: "After a few days of tracking, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies have managed to hunt down the Icetanian raiding party, and their numbers are staggering - they easily outnumber our forces four to one.\n\nIn the face of such overwhelming odds, there are some in camp who are begging [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to offer peace terms, but others view this as weakness and want to launch an attack."
 me_vasconian_28.a: "Our hands are tied...we must negotiate"
 me_vasconian_28.b: "We must strike now while we have the element of surprise!"
 
 me_vasconian_29_title: "Raiding Icetania"

"
 me_vasconian_30.a: "I am confident in our total victory over these barbarians"
 
 me_vasconian_31_title: "Raiding Icetania:Final"
 me_vasconian_31_desc: "In a curious development, the Icetanian raiders have refused our gifts, asking instead that we accept them into our territories as vassals.\n\nIt seems that some political instability amongst their Chieftains had caused a branch of their tribe to abandon their homelands, and our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] scouts mistakenly thought that they were coming to attack our territory.\n\nWhile some are unhappy that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has extended an olive branch to these foreigners, no one can deny that no blood was shed and that our numbers have swollen."
 me_vasconian_31.a: "I will always pursue peace first - I care not what others say"
 
 me_vasconian_32_title: "Raiding Icetania:Final"
 me_vasconian_32_desc: "Although the battle was fiercely contested by the Icetanians, and indeed, there were moments when it seemed that the raiders would gain the upper hand, our forces were able to secure victory, albeit it at a great cost.\n\nNevertheless, a win is a win, and all are in awe of the martial prowess of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who is able to vanquish forces larger than our own."

 me_vasconian_33_desc: "Some of the nobility have approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and have asked the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] to set aside some funds for the construction of a library.\n\nAs our power and status grwos, so too has our bureaucracy, and the upper classes want to ensure that we have a place to store records of business transactions."
 me_vasconian_33.a: "I agree with this idea - sure"
 me_vasconian_33.b: "No, I don't see the point"
 
 me_vasconian_34_title: "Chief City Of The Vascones:Market"
 me_vasconian_34_desc: "Feeling emboldened by their successful request, the nobles have gingerly approached our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] with a humble request - does [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have the funds to build a marketplace as well?"
 me_vasconian_34.a: "What a splendid idea - I'm surprised I didn't think of it myself"

Next to her, a small child is playing in the dirt, using sticks as makeshift toys and humming a soft tune. It is clear they have nothing, and yet they seem happy.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] suddenly feels a pang in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] chest and is filled with emotion. Dropping a gold coin into the beggar's bowl, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] walks away silently, unable to forget the image of the playing child."

There is laughter coming from an alleyway, and the smells of cooking pottage causes [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s stomach to growl.\n\nDucking into the small tavern, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] pays a few copper coins and sits at a table, eating the simple stew and drinking watered-down wine while listening to the conversations around [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim].\n\nMuch to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] surprise, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] realizes that these people are not Vasconian, but are Aquitanian - their accents give it away.\n\nCuriously, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] realizes that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has never met an Aquitanian in real life. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] finishes [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] meal in agreeable silence, enjoying the friendly chatter inside the shop."

Turning to the wisened heads gathered in the room, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice rising to a crescendo, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] raises a triumphant fist towards the sky.\n\n'I call you here to announce our greatest hour - in order to ensure the security and continuing stability of our people, the dream of #E Vasconia#! will be reorganized into the a Tribal Confederation!'\n\nAs bodyguards come to stand behind [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the speech continues.
