The other cities thoughout [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] cry out in shock at the loss of one of their eldest to the foreign Spartans, and men and women alike shudder at the thought of this Hellenic violation so close to their homes. Meanwhile Patavnos, now being called [GetProvince('(int32)3594').GetName] by its new hellenic rulers, lies in chaos. The Patavii aristocracy lie dead in the streets, and their citizens detest their brutal Greek overlords, though who is to say what state Kleomynos may make his new realm into.\n\n [GetProvince('(int32)3594').GetName] may one day grow to prosper under the governance of Kleomynos, but one thing is for certain right now: It will surely take a long time for the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people to come to terms with this terrible loss."

veneto_flavour_event.27.desc: "Under the leadership of prince [GetCharacter('(int32)176').GetPraenomen], we have adventured in many parts of the Adriatic, finally settleing in the Venetic lands after defeating those forces guarding the city of Patauion. With few prospects in our old home city, we can finally forge a new kingdom in these newly conquered lands. But these new helots of ours, the barbarian Patavi, are especially troublesome. Though we have slain much of their upper class, they nevertheless seem determined to destroy us all at any cost, and they still outnumber us greatly, much more so than the Helots did back in Sparta itself. It remains to be seen whether we will be able to stabilze our current possition, or whether the Patavi, or the external Venetic tribes, will succeed in driving us out."
