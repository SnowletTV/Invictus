veneto_flavour_event.27.desc: "Under the leadership of prince [GetCharacter('(int32)176').GetPraenomen], we have adventured in many parts of the Adriatic, finally settleing in the Venetic lands after defeating those forces guarding the city of Patauion. With few prospects in our old home city, we can finally forge a new kingdom in these newly conquered lands. But these new helots of ours, the barbarian Patavi, are especially troublesome. Though we have slain much of their upper class, they nevertheless seem determined to destroy us all at any cost, and they still outnumber us greatly, much more so than the Helots did back in Sparta itself. It remains to be seen whether we will be able to stabilze our current possition, or whether the Patavi, or the external Venetic tribes, will succeed in driving us out."
