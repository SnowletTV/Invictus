01_zhangzhung_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the most distant places of the world, where the ground turns into mighty mountains that reach up and seem to touch the very sky itself - this is the land where you will find our people, who have lived in the clefts of the hills and rocks since the the beginning of Time. There are few hearty enough to venture into our homelands, for the journey is difficult, but there are plenty of traders who risk their lives navigating the valleys and mountain passes in our territory, for we sit on the crossroads of many powerful and wealthy nations.\n\nThe time has come for us, too, to become powerful and wealthy."
01_zhangzhung_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have created a kingdom in the mountains - we must find a leader who can protect our people and lead the adherents of the Bon Faith into a glorious future."

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_17:0 "A Worthy Home"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "There is no gentle way of saying this; our capital city is pathetic. We must do everything we can to build our people a home that is worthy of their greatness, but this will take time and money. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Building a magnificent holy site in our capital city would prove to the world that our Bon faith guides every step of our movements.

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Feeding the empty stomachs of our citizens has always been a difficult task, no doubt due to the lack of suitable land for growing crops. This cannot be an excuse for any longer, however; we must take steps to increase the available foodstuffs available for our people. Why not take advantage of our terrain? We could build granaries deep inside of the mountains...the natural coolness of the stone would do wonders for preserving food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "Now that we have finally conquered the Tarim Basin, we should do what we can to bring peace to the region; we naturally want all of our subjects, regardless of their religion or culture, to get along with each other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_23:0 "Plugging the Cracks"
01_zhangzhung_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "We cannot tolerate a porous border, but must take the steps required to secure the mountain passes. But what good are the best of fortifications if the people themselves are not united? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

Still, with careful planning, the worst of this can be mitigated, especially if you have a leader as conscientious as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is. Although spending money on farms is not popular when budgets are tight, everyone certainly enjoys a loaf of freshly-baked bread straight from the oven - a treat that all will get to enjoy more frequently, now that we have expanded our storage capacity by ingeniously building granaries in the mountains themselves. We truly have a visionary leader guiding our nation forward."

You will soon see that we are as civilized as many other countries, and our cities can offer delights to the traveler that will rival anything you will find in the storied capitals of the great kingdoms."
