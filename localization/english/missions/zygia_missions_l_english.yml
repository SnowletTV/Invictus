What shall be done?"

me_zygia_16.b: "Let nature be."

me_zygia_17_title: "Unity of the Zygii Chiefs"
me_zygia_17_desc: "Having a greater say towards the future of the clans, each Zygian chief feels part of a greater whole rather than a diverse group of factions.

There is no consensus among the people whether the tale can be considered true or not. Among them, a local hero has risen, named [zygian_hero.GetName], has elected to retrace the steps of #E Pizighash#!, and simply requires some funding for his journey. If we do not indulge him, he is likely to go off on his own anyway, but he may never return, fool boy he is."

It was here that he struck the ground with his sword, as had the hero of old, and waited for the waves to part. \n\nWhile the Maeotis itseld did not budge for him, a startled nest of birds rustled the leaves of a nearby grove and took off in a hurry, leading his attention to an old burrow, a cavern's maw, which led down into the dark earth; he heard the sound of water splashing against dirt walls echo from the cave."

They were amazed to see [zygian_hero.GetName] both safe and in company with so divine a woman. Many attempted to ask him questions. Some saw him as part divine himself, having supposedly achieved the adventure of the Narts, the gods themselves. \n\nHe waived them all off and proceeded to the temple of the #E Lady of the Flowing Waters#! instead. Within the boundaries of her shrine, her holy domain, he knelt and offered both a sacrifice and a gift: a white pendant bearing the image of a dove. His duty fulfilled, her merrily rejoined the populace and married his maiden before all the gods."

Climbing the great, divine tree, he took a closer look upon the apple's shining surface, only to realize that his face reflected off of its marbled surface. He spun the fruit around its bud, and realized that, whilst it was not a hard, stone of white, it did have a milky sheen in its yellow half. The other face of the apple appeared almost painted in a bloody crimson, a deep and disturbing shade. \n\nBefore he could catch himself, it loosened within his grip and separated from the tree. The boy fell, and died on impact, but the strange apple was brought by another guard nearby to court, where it was presented to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. All knew the tale of the tree of the Narts and its divine fruit, but seeing and testing was a caution-driven endeavor. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] quickly handed it over to a female attendant and bade her to test the divine nature of the fruit."
