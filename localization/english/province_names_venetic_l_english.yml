PROV3584_venetic:0 "Verona" 
PROV3589_venetic:0 "Hostillia" 
PROV3593_venetic:0 "Atria"   #Early city name, it is unknown what the Veneti called it
PROV3594_venetic:0 "Patavnos" #attested https://www.academia.edu/74888843/A_Venetic_Sound_Change
PROV3595_venetic:0 "Ateste"    
PROV3596_venetic:0 "Veiketinos" #alegedly attested (italian wikipedia) and https://www.jstor.org/stable/41746973?seq=13 (I also switched the c to a k, since the Venetic alphabet used a kappa)
PROV3597_venetic:0 "Anneianon" #settlement from 163.ac onwards, so there wouldn't be any authentic Venetic name for the settlement. So I just 'veneticised' the later Roman name a bit.
PROV3598_venetic:0 "Altinon"   #somewhat attested, city named after the venetic god Altino #2022 source: https://www.torrossa.com/en/resources/an/5310859 - This source suggests either Altinom or Altinon, but Altinon is more in line with the attestation of Akelon, and is the same spelling of the name as attested by strabo in greek.
PROV3599_venetic:0 "Tarvosion" #Tarvisium in latin alegedly stems from a Venetic Theonym including the Celtic god Tarvos. So I have made it a derivative - edited derivative to 'ion' instead of 'ios', as 'ios' would be more characteristic of a personal theonym.
PROV3600_venetic:0 "Akelon"   #my guess, Acelum in latin / also attested in an inscription near Asolo (suggested as a Toponym for Asolo, in which case my guess was very lucky): https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/aristonothos/article/view/13730/12926
PROV3601_venetic:0 "Portos Likventia"   #my guess - qu -> kv, latin 'equus' -> venetic 'ekvos', and based on the Proto-Italic word for Liquidae in latin
PROV3603_venetic:0 "Opitergios"   #my guess, terg (venetic root for market) ios (of/from) Opi (in the latin name of Opitergium, probably comes from the original name). 
PROV3604_venetic:0 "Belodunon"   #my guess, venetic version of Belo-dunun
PROV3605_venetic:0 "Foron Rakos" #Foron, my guess for the Venetic of Forum, based on both the Proto-Italic Pworom, with Rakos, wich is likely the Venetic equivalent to Rex
PROV3606_venetic:0 "Akileia"   #Akileja - Carnian name before the Roman arrival
PROV3590_venetic:0 "Monteboulenos" #Montebellum, this gramatical case for 'mountain' in Venetic was probably very similar to latin, and Bellum aparrently comes from the celtic god Bellenos (or Boulenos in Venetic). - found no reliable source, will disable untill frurther notice
PROV4018_venetic:0 "Tergeste" 
PROV3602_venetic:0 "Konkordia" #The latin name of the city has the same roots as in Venetic, so I just changed the Cs to Ks, as the Veneti used the letter K for the K sound.
PROV4026_venetic:0 "Longatikon" #Taken from the Illyrian loc - seems to be in line with venetic phonology
PROV4025_venetic:0 "Karnion" #Taken from the Illyrian loc - seems to be in line with venetic phonology
PROV1887_venetic:0 "Pompeion" #Pomeii, my guess ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY 
PROV3571_venetic:0 "Mediolanos" #my guess - Mediios -> Medio  ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY 
PROV3581_venetic:0 "Briksia" #my guess, replaces 'x' with ks, as the veneti didn't have a letter x ///PLAUSIBLE BUT UNECESSARY, NOT A VENETIC HELD TERRITORY
PROV144_venetic:0 "Spina"
