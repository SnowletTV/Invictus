With the relentless colonization by the power-hungry Greeks and Carthaginians, it seems all hope is lost for Siculia, destined to fade into history along with the rest of their kin. Is Siculia's fate truly sealed, or can a great leader in the mold of Ducetius rise from the dim twilight to defy the insurmountable odds and bring about a new Sicel dawn over Sicily?"

  bosporan_start: "#t Bosporan Kingdom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Normal#!\n\nSpartokos I was a mercenary captain related to the rulers of the Odrysian Kingdom. Hired by the tyrant of Pantikapaion, Archaeanactid the King of the Bosporus, the exceptional military prowess and strategic acumen of Spartokis saw his influence steadily expand and earned him the loyalty of the troops serving alongside him. Eventually, he launched a coup against the Archaeanactids, taking Pantikapaion for himself and establishing the Spartokid Dynasty in their place.\n\nDuring their three centuries of rule, the Spartokids expanded the Bosporan Kingdom's holdings from a handful of loosely-connected cities huddled around the Kerch Peninsula to a bonafide Hellenic kingdom capable of standing as a bulwark against Scythian and Sarmatian expansion."

But the era of subservience to empires and overlords must end. The waves that have borne our ships to every corner of the known world will now carry us toward dominance, both on land and at sea.
