 rel_flavor_persia.1.desc:0 "The cults of #E Persia#! are plentiful, colorful, and incredibly attractive to adopt. It will be quite easy for us to adapt our very malleable religious traditions with #E Persian#! cults. There are those known as #E Zoroastrians#!, who worship #E Ahura Mazda#!, the lord of the skies, above all; citing the prophet #E Zoroaster#! as an important figure. Or perhaps the cult of #E Mithra#!, the lord of light, exaulted by the #E Median Magi#!. We could, of course, try to impost our own #E Heptadic#! faith upon the denizens of #E Persia#!. Or, we could look to the #E Seleukids#! and #E Macedonian#! cults of #E Zeus#!, #E Aphrodite#!, and #E Hades#! amongst others. And then there are the lands of #E Mesopotamia#! with their gods like #E Ishtar#!, #E Ereshkigal#!, #E Humban#!.\n\nThe choice is ours to make. Let us decide which cult will be the one of #E Persia's#! future."
