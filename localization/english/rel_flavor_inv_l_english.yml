 rel_flavor_persia.1.desc:0 "The cults of #E Persia#! are plentiful, colorful, and incredibly attractive to adopt. It will be quite easy for us to adapt our very malleable religious traditions with #E Persian#! cults. There are those known as #E Zoroastrians#!, who worship #E Ahura Mazda#!, the lord of the skies, above all; citing the prophet #E Zoroaster#! as an important figure. Or perhaps the cult of #E Mithra#!, the lord of light, exaulted by the #E Median Magi#!. We could, of course, try to impost our own #E Heptadic#! faith upon the denizens of #E Persia#!. Or, we could look to the #E Seleukids#! and #E Macedonian#! cults of #E Zeus#!, #E Aphrodite#!, and #E Hades#! amongst others. And then there are the lands of #E Mesopotamia#! with their gods like #E Ishtar#!, #E Ereshkigal#!, #E Humban#!.\n\nThe choice is ours to make. Let us decide which cult will be the one of #E Persia's#! future."

 rel_flavor_persia.5.t:0 "Rule as you Will"
 rel_flavor_persia.5.desc:0 "The family of Alexander is dead, yet he still casts a large shadow over the world. In this corner of the world is left you, Oxyartes, the father-in-law. Because of your brave nature, excellent diplomacy, and far-off territory, you can largely rule Paropamisadae as you'd like.\n\nThe matter of faith has yet to be answered. As a former Persian satrap, the region of Paropamisadae has historically followed the Mazdayan rites of the Persians, yet the Oxyartid line comes from the Sogdian-Bactrian variety of the faith. The choice remains with you on how to lead this nation forward."

 rel_flavor_persia.6.desc:0 "Oxyartes was indeed a great ruler, but with his strong hand, the country is at a crossroads. Our high autonomy allows us to determine our own future, although not with some growing pains depending on the route we choose. We may continue under satrapical rule, obeying the Oxyartid dynasty, or, we may determine that instead a local Sattagydian dynast should be chosen."
 rel_flavor_persia.6.a:0 "We cannot betray the legacy of Oxyartes."
 rel_flavor_persia.6.b:0 "We need no foreign governors."

 sattagydian_heritage_desc:0 "Sattagydia, or in Old Persian, Thatagush, means 'Country of the Hundred Cows.' Nestled between the Hindu-Kush mountain range and as one of the most eastern points of the Achaemenid and Argead empires, the Sattagydians were a necessary gateway to the rest of India. Columns in Persepolis show us that Sattagydians were more Indic than Arachosia or Bactria in clothing. They are also said to be the Indians whho travelled all the way to Greece to fight for the Persians."
