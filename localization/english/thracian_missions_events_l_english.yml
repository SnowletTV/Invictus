Still further north, across the protective breadth of the great river Istros, lie the lands of the Getae, sending their raids over the river's fords to ravage the lands of the Greek colonies on the western shore of the Pontus Euxinus - cities that are the very treasury of the satrapy. And all the while, to the south, as Thrace bridges the Greek and Asian worlds through control of the Hellespont, it is only a matter of time before one will seek to invade the other and send an army through Thrace to do it.\n\nFor decades Lysimachos, through cunning, diplomacy, and sheer military genius, managed to keep out of these Successor Wars, while countering each and every threat presented to him by the barbarians to his north - defying all the odds by maintaining the integrity of the satrapy.
