 zorgo_event.1.t: "Settling Old Scores"
 zorgo_event.1.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], there is a delicate matter that will require your personal attention. We have heard reports that [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetName] has been threatening to kill [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetName] over real estate; it seems that they both want the same property in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and neither is backing down. The war of words has continued to escalate over the last few weeks, and just last night, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] was attacked outside of [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetHerHis] home and was badly beaten, ultimately losing an eye.\n\nWhile we normally wouldn't trouble you with such things, your blood relation with [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude').GetFirstName] complicates the issue - [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] has been telling everyone that you sent your henchmen over there to teach [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetHerHim] a lesson, and people are starting to listen."
 zorgo_event.1.a: "Send [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2').GetFirstName] a gift from the treasury and our profuse apologies"
 zorgo_event.1.b: "Tell that fool to keep their mouth shut if they'd like to keep the other one!"

 zorgo_event.2.t: "A Curious Discovery"
 zorgo_event.2.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], a farmer was working in the fields near [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] when a weird aberration was unearthed; a silver idol of some rustic, long-forgotten god, covered in strange runes that are indecipherable. [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetName], who is an expert in such matters, has said a malevolent spirit is trapped inside the statuette and that we have unwittingly unleashed a curse. While [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetFirstName] has said this is a terrible omen for our people, not everyone is convinced that this is a stroke of bad luck."
 zorgo_event.2.a: "Melt the statue down and make coins - I am not afraid of some ancient spirit"
 zorgo_event.2.b: "Tell [SCOPE.sCharacter('priest').GetFirstName] to rebury it in the same spot and to offer sacrifices"

 zorgo_event.3.t: "A Gift From The Sea"
 zorgo_event.3.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was fast asleep in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] bedchambers when, all of a sudden, there were loud screams and the sounds of breaking furniture, ripping [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] reverie. There was a flash of steel, and a few frantic moments later, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s bodyguards were holding [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetName] on the ground.\n\nWhat came next was a story so ridiculous, so strange, that for a moment, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] thought that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] was still dreaming. But no, this actually happened; it appears that [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName], clearly a simpleton, had purchased a gigantic tuna in the fish market and had brought it to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] as a present. How he managed to sneak past your sentries in the middle of the night remains a mystery.\n\nWhen pressed for more details, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName] keeps sobbing the same story - 'It's the biggest fish I've ever seen, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], and I just had to give it to you. I didn't mean any harm, honest'. In fairness, next to [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetHerHis] feet is truly the largest tuna you have ever seen."
 zorgo_event.3.a: "Um...thanks, I guess? Here, take some gold for your troubles"
 zorgo_event.3.b: "Guards, beat this idiot with the tuna and throw them both in the street!"
 zorgo_event.3.c: "That was the dumbest thing you've ever done, [SCOPE.sCharacter('dumbass').GetFirstName]."

 zorgo_event.4.t: "Observing the Master"
 zorgo_event.4.desc: "Lately, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetName] has been pestering [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] almost daily with a simple request, one that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cannot ignore for much longer. What [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName] has asked for is simple enough, if a little embarrassing; all that [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetSheHe] wants is the chance to observe [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] during the next Council meeting. Being somewhat inexperienced with political matters, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName] would like to watch 'the Master at work', so to speak, in hopes of learning how to deal with advisors."
 zorgo_event.4.a: "You can sit behind me, but keep quiet and don't appear too eager"
 zorgo_event.4.b: "You will have plenty of time to learn on your own one day"

 zorgo_event.5.t: "Overflowing Granaries"
 zorgo_event.5.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the harvests were so plentiful this year that we have run out of room to store the wheat. The granaries that we have built near [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are packed to bursting, and there is simply no room left for what we have on hand - we will just have to sell the excess at market."
 zorgo_event.5.a: "We are glad that we are not wanting for food - the people should rejoice!"

 zorgo_event.6.t: "Tax Collector Murdered"
 zorgo_event.6.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we are sorry to inform you that one of our tax collectors, a man named [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetName], was found stabbed to death in the streets of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Everyone claims that [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetFirstName] was known to have 'sticky fingers' and skimmed much more off of the top for himself than he should have, and while this might be true, was the man deserving of such a violent death? Now, the locals are refusing to tell us who was responsible for the crime, even though our soldiers have been threatening them if they don't speak...this does not bode well."
 zorgo_event.6.a: "This is terribly vexing to hear...farewell, [SCOPE.sCharacter('taxman').GetFirstName]"

 zorgo_event.7.t: "Barbarian Raid"
 zorgo_event.7.desc: "We have terrible news to report this morning, o [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. A band of barbarian raiders has been pillaging the region of [temple_province.GetName], crossing the river in the middle of the night and catching our guards unawares. Not only have the bandits managed to steal a bit of gold, which is bad, but they killed some locals, which is worse - our people mourn their lost lives and property today."
 zorgo_event.7.a: "We will do everything within our power to punish those responsible!"

 zorgo_event.8.t: "A Song for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]"
 zorgo_event.8.desc: "A few days ago, two famed troubadours that are known for singing in unison, [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard_2').GetName], arrived in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and requested an audience with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] whenever [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has the time. The reason for the visit was known even before they arrived in our capital, for the reputation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard').GetFirstName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('bard_2').GetFirstName] certainly precedes them, and their latest masterwork, an epic poem entitled 'The Mighty Deeds of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]', has been the talk of the town for weeks.\n\nThe two poets have humbly asked for the chance to perform, and later on this evening, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] shall have the honor of hearing the famous piece recited in person."
 zorgo_event.8.a: "At least the subject matter will be interesting..."

 zorgo_event.9.t: "An Uncovered Plot"
 zorgo_event.9.desc: "At the last moment, our agents uncovered a plot to have [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] assassinated, and as more and more details are revealed, the scandal continues to grow, shocking the inhabitants of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\nThe rot runs deep; it seems that the perpetrators were able to persuade one of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s relatives, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetName], to join their number. Indeed, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] was the lynchpin of the entire operation, for it was hoped that [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetSheHe] would have been able to bring [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] someplace secluded where the murderers would have been hiding. In fact, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was supposed to pay a visit tomorrow afternoon... \n\nWhen the intrigue was discovered, [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] tried to flee in the middle of the night, hoping to find a ship to take [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetHerHim] anywhere, but was arrested at the harbor. What shall we do?"
 zorgo_event.9.a: "Throw [SCOPE.sCharacter('cousin').GetFirstName] into the deepest pit...for now"

 zorgo_event.10.t: "The Wandering Merchant"
 zorgo_event.10.desc: "A few days ago, a foreigner named [SCOPE.sCharacter('euthymios').GetName] was apprehended on the outskirts of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and brought before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], where it was demanded that the stranger explain himself. In a former life, [SCOPE.sCharacter('euthymios').GetFirstName] was a merchant, hailing from the city of [GetProvince('(int32)416').GetName], but political upheaval in his hometown resulted in his banishment. After wandering for years, Euthymios has finally reached our lands, destitute and weary.\n\nOnce he is standing before [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], Euthymios extends a tiny coinpurse and falls to his knees. 'Please, gracious one, accept all that I have left in this life, but allow me to stay here with you. I can't go on any further'.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is inclined to show mercy, but there will undoubtedly be complaints amongst the locals, who have no desire to live with the exiled trader in their midst."
 zorgo_event.10.a: "Our hospitality to the stranger is well-known; you may stay with us"
 zorgo_event.10.b: "Tell this fool to leave our city at once! What a preposterous thought"

 zorgo_event.11.t: "Woven Wind"
 zorgo_event.11.desc: "Although [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is known to enjoy the finer things in life, as of late, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has been perturbed by the growing signs of extravagant wealth in our society. Far too many of our nobles are spending their money on importing silk clothing, which colloquially is known as 'woven wind' because of its gossamer nature, and the streets are filled with dandies that spend their days talking of fashion, which is certainly not a [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] virtue.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has been considering restricting such frivolous things, but is well aware that there could be a push-back from the cultural elites."
 zorgo_event.11.a: "Enough is enough - outlaw the wearing of silk clothing for one year"
 zorgo_event.11.b: "Bah! I have more important things to worry about...leave me alone"

 zorgo_event.12.t: "Exhibition at The Grand Cothon"
 zorgo_event.12.desc: "We have heard news that there is to be a grand unveiling at the Grand Cothon in [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetName], as some recent renovations have been completed in the harbor district and the architects are eager to show off the latest additions. Only the most prestigious families have been invited to the exhibition, and naturally this includes [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. The cream of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] society will be in attendance, and it is quickly turning out to be the most talked about event of the year.\n\nAlthough being invited is a great honor, there will be costs associated the trip; it's up to you, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. The people will certainly want their leader to attend, but can our treasuries support such a thing?"
 zorgo_event.12.a: "Travel is expensive but it broadens the mind - we shall go!"
 zorgo_event.12.b: "I am too busy to visit myself, but I am excited to hear about it"

 zorgo_event.13.t: "Offerings to Tannit"
 zorgo_event.13.desc: "Every five years, all of the nations that remember the goddess Tannit and her kindnesses are obliged to send a gift to her temple in [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetName], a time-honored tradition that our people are only too happy to embrace.\n\nAs the ceremony approaches, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been reminded by [SCOPE.sCharacter('jerk').GetName] that we did not send the tributes last time, asking for an extension due to some financial difficulties. It is unfortunate, but we have to send double the amount if we want to remain in the goddess's good graces."
 zorgo_event.13.a: "What are we without the gods? Although it stings, send the funds"
 zorgo_event.13.b: "I care not what I promised - we can't afford this"

 zorgo_event.14.t: "Forced to Intervene In Trade Disputes"
 zorgo_event.14.desc: "Although we try our best not to trouble you, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], there is a tricky matter that will require your personal touch. Two merchants, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_bro').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_bro_2').GetName], have been involved in a very public and very ugly argument about waterfront property near [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] - it seems they both want the same warehouses for storing amphorae. Both are ambitious merchants, rivals in the public space, and their war of words is threatening to spill over into violence unless something is done.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] will have to sit in judgment, and there are no easy solutions - someone is bound to get upset."
 zorgo_event.14.a: "I have chosen [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_bro_2').GetName]"
 zorgo_event.14.b: "Clearly [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_bro').GetName] is more deserving"
 zorgo_event.14.c: "Threaten them both with exile unless they stop arguing"

 zorgo_event.15.t: "Restoring the Temple of Melqart"
 zorgo_event.15.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received words of a terrible omen in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)743').GetName]. An awful earthquake has devastated the Temple of Melqart, and the Tyrian priests have sent messengers to all of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] cities, asking for alms to help restore the damaged holy site. There are large cracks in the structure's stereobate, and there are fears that, unless work begins immediately, the entire temple could collapse.\n\nAlthough requests for money are never welcome news, it is known that Melqart takes care of his faithful - our citizens would be very pleased knowing that they helped contribute."
 zorgo_event.15.a: "Because the gods take care of us, we shall take care of them"
 zorgo_event.15.b: "We send enough tithes to the Tyros as it is - no"

 zorgo_event.16.t: "The Explorer Returns"
 zorgo_event.16.desc: "We have certainly heard stories of [SCOPE.sCharacter('traveler').GetName], the intrepid traveler that idolizes Hanno the Navigator, for any city with access to the sea has heard of the daring missions that [SCOPE.sCharacter('traveler').GetFirstName] has embarked upon. With only Hanno's notes to guide him, [SCOPE.sCharacter('traveler').GetFirstName] sets sail for the Ocean every season, going farther and farther down the coast of Africa before returning home, often with exotic goods to sell and stories that are worth their weight in gold.\n\nImagine our surprise, then, when the legendary explorer passed through [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], asking to meet with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. It seems that, just like Hanno, [SCOPE.sCharacter('traveler').GetFirstName] has encountered the strange tribe of the fearsome Gorillai people, and is willing to trade to us a curiosity if we can afford it. Our people would be greatly interested in seeing such a spectacle for themselves..."
 zorgo_event.16.a: "We cannot spare the coin right now"
 zorgo_event.16.b: "What *is* that?! I have never seen anything like it before...we need it"

 zorgo_event.17.t: "A Distracted Pupil"
 zorgo_event.17.desc: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('teacher').GetName] has been entrusted with tutoring [SCOPE.sCharacter('pupil').GetName] in all things [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName]; a simple enough task, or so we thought, and one that pays very well for the privilege of instructing a member of the nobility. Unfortunately for us, [SCOPE.sCharacter('teacher').GetFirstName] has been complaining that [SCOPE.sCharacter('pupil').GetFirstName] is not paying attention at all during the daily lectures, often falling asleep in the middle of class. When [SCOPE.sCharacter('teacher').GetFirstName] has gently asked [SCOPE.sCharacter('pupil').GetFirstName] to pay attention, the spoiled brat threw a goblet of wine at the teacher, who is now threatening to quit!"
 zorgo_event.17.a: "The nerve...threaten [SCOPE.sCharacter('pupil').GetFirstName] if they don't shape up!"
 zorgo_event.17.b: "I don't care about this at all - please don't bother me again"

 zorgo_event.18.t: "Slave Ships At Port"
 zorgo_event.18.desc: "We have received word that some pirates are passing through the area and that the holds of their ships filled with slaves they have kidnapped. This is not all; it seems that these raiders are being pursued by whomever they attacked, and, fearful of being caught, they are now trying to rid themselves of their ill-gotten gains.\n\nAccording to the leader of the pirates, a scoundrel named [SCOPE.sCharacter('pirate').GetName], their enemies are less than a day behind them, so time is of the essence. Because of their haste, they are willing to offer us discounted prices...if we are willing to do business with them."
 zorgo_event.18.a: "We will not get involved with this - tell the pirates to leave our waters!"
 zorgo_event.18.b: "Buy a couple of slaves"
 zorgo_event.18.c: "We will buy all that they are willing to sell"

 zorgo_event.19.t: "Steady Hands Steering the Ship"
 zorgo_event.19.desc: "One morning, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was searching [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for their successor, only to be informed that they were out on the waters, practicing sailing maneuvers with our navy.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was pleased at this bit of news, hoping that others will notice the spirit of self-sacrifice and follow suit."
 zorgo_event.19.a: "If only everyone took their duties as seriously as we do..."

 zorgo_event.20.t: "Renowned Orator"
 zorgo_event.20.desc: "A famous speaker, one [SCOPE.sCharacter('orator').GetName] by name, has arrived in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and has quietly made it known that [SCOPE.sCharacter('orator').GetSheHe] would happily give a public speech in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s honor, especially if we are able to give a small donation.\n\nRealizing that a gift has fallen right into [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] lap, there is no hesitation on [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s part, and preparations are made immediately."
 zorgo_event.20.a: "I have no qualms supporting such a worthy cause"

 zorgo_event.21.t: "A Sign From Jupiter"
 zorgo_event.21.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have heard a strange and disturbing tale that is making the rounds in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. It seems that one of our citizens erected a colossal bronze statue of #E Herakles#! in the center of town, and almost immediately, a bolt of lightning struck the plinth and sent the metalwork crashing into the ground.\n\nOf course, everyone is taking this as a sign of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_jupiter').GetName|Y]'s displeasure, who is punishing us Romans for our hubris."
 zorgo_event.21.a: "Command that the statue be buried and give sacrifices"
 zorgo_event.21.b: "Build a massive fire and melt the idol down for coins"

 zorgo_event.22.t: "The Harbor At Ostia"
 zorgo_event.22.desc: "Our architects report that the harbor at [GetProvince('(int32)15').GetName] is beginning to show signs of silting over, and unless we take the painful but necessary steps to start dredging the waters, we could have a long-term problem on our hands. Even now, the laborers at the docks have to work twice as hard to get the ships in and out, and many times, our sailors end up having to help and they are starting to complain."
 zorgo_event.22.a: "I guess we have no real choice in the matter"
 zorgo_event.22.b: "Tell the men to work harder; we cannot spare the coin"

 zorgo_event.23.t: "Arguments Among The Aristocracy"
 zorgo_event.23.desc: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_from_rome').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2_from_rome').GetName] have both approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], ambushing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] one pleasant afternoon in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and immediately spoiling the mood.\n\nIt seems that there was to be a wedding between the families of [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_from_rome').GetPraenomen] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2_from_rome').GetPraenomen], but arguments over the dowry have caused an irrevocable rift, one that threatens to spill into the political arena unless we intermediate. Now, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_from_rome').GetFirstName] is asking that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] agree to hear the sordid details, with hopes that a resolution condemning [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude_2_from_rome').GetFirstName] will be passed.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this case is too high profile, and regardless of how we rule, the people of #E Rome#! will have strong opinions either way."
 zorgo_event.23.a: "I will honorably sit in judgment, knowing that I cannot win"
 zorgo_event.23.b: "Eh, see who will pay us the most and side with them"

 zorgo_event.24.t: "A Slacker Student"
 zorgo_event.24.desc: "We keep hearing complaints that [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetName] has been ignoring his daily lessons, avoiding the study of Greek grammar and instead racing around on his favorite horse, Ungula Fulgens.\n\nEven at his tender age, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName] is known for his prowess with riding - truthfully, the child is better than men twice his age - and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can hardly blame the boy for wanting a bit of excitement, but the commoners are starting to complain, saying that a higher standard should be set for a member of our family."
 zorgo_event.24.a: "Hire the best Greek tutors and threaten [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir').GetFirstName]"
 zorgo_event.24.b: "Let the child play...what harm is there?"

 zorgo_event.25.t: "Impromptu Celebrations"
 zorgo_event.25.desc: "Our people are unlike any other - no matter what Fate or Fortune brings them, be it times of war and suffering or years of fat and excess, they never abandon the gods, ceaselessly offering praise and thanksgiving. We should count ourselves fortunate to have such pious Roman citizens, for the gods are delighted by the impromptu celebrations that take place in the countryside."
 zorgo_event.25.a: "How delightful!"

 zorgo_event.26.t: "Unprecedented Measures"
 zorgo_event.26.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], as you know, our recent campaigns have left us with a dearth of manpower - a fact that we cannot allow our enemies to discover, lest we invite destruction.\n\nIn this desperate moment, it has been suggested that we impress some slaves into military service. While this certainly goes against Roman precedent, we might not have a choice. The people will complain and our stability will suffer, but do we have any other options?"
 zorgo_event.26.a: "I wish we didn't have to do this, but my hands are tied"
 zorgo_event.26.b: "I will never allow slaves to fight alongside free men"

 zorgo_event.27.t: "Tension In The Senate"
 zorgo_event.27.desc: "The nobility in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have been pushing for a change in our military laws, arguing that we have been too permissive in allowing the lower classes to fight. In addition to reinstating wealth requirements for military service, it has been argued that only citizens and nobles should be allowed to lead our troops in battle.\n\nThe lower classes, as it is known, are not authorized to take auspices by observing the sacred chickens, and the thought of fighting without knowing the will of the gods has greatly irritated the more conservative elements in our society."
 zorgo_event.27.a: "Give the #Y Optimates#! what they want"
 zorgo_event.27.b: "I will not be bullied by the moneyed classes!"

 zorgo_event.28.t: "Breakdown Of Discipline"
 zorgo_event.28.desc: "We regret to inform you, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], that our armies are becoming more and more comfortable with pillaging the foreign territories they are marching through, even going so far as to ignore orders to leave the locals alone. Our generals admit that this is a problem, but so far, no one has been willing to properly punish the soldiers lest a mutinous spirit take over the men."
 zorgo_event.28.a: "As punishment, no campfires allowed for dinner for five years!"
 zorgo_event.28.b: "Reintroduce decimation, and spare no perpetrators"

 zorgo_event.29.t: "The Talking Bird"
 zorgo_event.29.desc: "One morning, a merchant named [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_talking_bird_merchant').GetName] came up to the #E Palatine Hill#! with an intriguing offer; for the price of ten gold coins, he would be willing to sell a talking crow named 'Mica Aurea', one trained to sing the praises of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Amused by this idea, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] agreed to hear a demonstration in the Senate House.\n\nA few moments later, however, the bird began squawking loudly '[SCOPE.sCharacter('coruler_head_of_family').GetName] is the greatest #E Consul#! in Roman history' - how embarrassing! It seems that [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_talking_bird_merchant').GetFirstName] has taught the bird to say multiple names, and now the little beast has shamed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] in front of everyone! Waves of laughter are rippling through the Curia."
 zorgo_event.29.a: "I can take a joke at my own expense...it's no big deal"
 zorgo_event.29.b: "Kill the bird, and kill [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_talking_bird_merchant').GetFirstName]!"

 zorgo_event.30.t: "Stopping A Slave Revolt"
 zorgo_event.30.desc: "We have discovered a plot in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to arm household slaves in hopes of overthrowing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s regime. Although such a foolish dream was doomed to failure, the fact that the conspiracy was in a late stage is very concerning. A large number of swords were found hidden in a safehouse in the outskirts of the #E Subura#! region in Rome, and it seems that the attack was to take place tomorrow - we barely squeaked by.\n\nThe #E Via Appia#! is now filled with the writhing bodies of the crucified, a deadly reminder to any who hold treacherous thoughts in their hearts."
 zorgo_event.30.a: "That was a close one..."

 zorgo_event.31.t: "Quartan Fever"
 zorgo_event.31.desc: "There are rumors of an outbreak of quartan fever along the coasts, no doubt brought to our shores by foreign merchants.\n\nThankfully, our [GetOffice('office_apothecary').GetCulturalName(ROOT.GetCharacter.GetCountry)], [SCOPE.sCharacter('apothecary').GetName], seized the initiative on [SCOPE.sCharacter('apothecary').GetHerHis] own accord and ordered that no one be allowed to leave the region, but the commoners are unhappy with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] for not protecting them."
 zorgo_event.31.a: "Curses! Lock down the port until the sickness has gone"

 zorgo_event.32.t: "The Price Of Playing Politics"
 zorgo_event.32.desc: "Everyone in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is aware of [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_house_head').GetName]'s attempts to use their familial connections to buy political power; it seems that everyone, from the lowliest bodyguards to the Heads of Great Families, has received a bribe from the purse of [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_house_head').GetFirstName].\n\nImagine [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_house_head').GetFirstName]'s disgust, then, when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] summoned [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_house_head').GetHerHim] to the capital to demand a cut..."
 zorgo_event.32.a: "I don't know what you're up to, but don't forget me..."

 zorgo_event.33.t: "The Gift Of Knowledge"
 zorgo_event.33.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received a peculiar gift from a foreign King, one that wishes to remain anonymous.
