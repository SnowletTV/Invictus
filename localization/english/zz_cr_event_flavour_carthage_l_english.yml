 startup_events.2.t:0 "Heirs of Dido"
 startup_events.2.desc:0 "500 years ago wise queen Elishat fled the intrigues of her brother Pumayyaton and the court of [GetProvince('(int32)743').GetName]. Embarking on a years long odyssey across the Mediterranean, she arrived here to found her New City. Even so from our humble beginnings our neighbors have been trying to dominate us; from the Numidian kings who constrained us and forced us to pay tribute to our Phoenician sisters who sought to dominate our trade.\n\nYet we persevered, and yet we overcame: we have established ourselves as the vital hub of Mediterranean trade. Our port overflows with goods from all over the known world; tin from the Cassiterides, salt and iron from beyond the Pillars of Hercules, copper and silver from Iberia, ivory and gold from beyond the deserts and, of course, glass and dyes of our own making.\n\nWe truly are a blessed people.\n\nYet blessings bring with them jealousy. Jealousy from those who cannot find the favor of the Gods. And so we must remain vigilant, and protect our glorious city from lesser peoples. For across the sea the most miserable amongst the Greeks, [GetCharacter('(int32)56').GetPraenomen], still reigns in Syracuse. And even further north, in the uncivilized lands of Italy, stir those who style themselves as the heirs of Aeneas..."

Honoring the god who brought them to that wonderous place, they sacrificed the flaming eagle to Melqart.

He is offering to show us its location in exchange for a small sum...\n\nThe statue itself he describes as a magnificent work of art depicting Gelon as a kalathos dancer -an initiate of Apollo.
