 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.1.desc:0 "When Agathokles invaded Africa in opposition to the Carthaginians, he called upon all of the Greeks to help him deal with his erstwhile enemies. Our previous ruler, Ophellas, answered the call and set out along the Syrtis to join Agathokles in Africa, being promised vast stretches of territory in Africa. Yet, when he arrived there, Agathokles promptly killed him and took control of our army.\n\nThe Carthaginians, while they managed push Agathokles back to Sicily, seemed unwilling to risk another such episode. Now, they have come to us with a proposition: in order to settle on a permanent division of the two Syrtis into spheres of influence and prevent future conflict, they propose a running contest between their best runners and ours, who - departing on the same day - will settle the border in whatever place they happen to meet."

The Cyrenaicans, having been delayed either by storm or laziness, have accused the Philaeni of cheating and gave them a choice: either they agree to be buried alive in this spot, and that is where the border will run, or they will allow the Cyrenaicans to travel further until they agree to have the same done to them..."

Yet, when accused of cheating, the Philaeni allowed themselves to be buried alive to preserve their honor and that of their countrymen. Their burial mounts now demarcate where the border will run."

Yet the Carthaginians surprised us, and their envoys met ours far further east than we would have expected. It seems the treacherous Carthaginians did not leave matters to fate. Not willing to press the issue, both parties agreed to settle the border at the place they met, roughly halfway between the two Syrtis."

For two years we've been working to secure our city against future invasion, and the hard work has paid off: a series of three ever more impressive walls now stretch across the isthmus which connects Carthage to the main land. The first wall is little more than a ditch and palisade, but the third rises 15 meters above the plains in front of it, with towers even 9 meters taller.\n\nNo longer will we have to fear a repeat of Agathokles' invasion: these walls are sure to stop even the most determined of invaders."

 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.12.desc:0 "At the Hydaspes, Alexander first encountered elephants in battle and introduced the world to their effectiveness. Facing such beasts in battle is said to be a terrifying experience and more than once they have succeeded in turning a battle around. Such an impression these beasts made that it seems the Greek conquerors themselves have resorted to the use of elephants in battle.\n\nIt so happens that our lands, too, are home to elephants which, while not as ferocious as their eastern counterparts, can be tamed and trained for war. To make us of this potential, the walls of Carthage have been prepared with pens capable of housing 200 of these beasts, should the need arise."
 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.12.a:0 "A brave, well trained, elephant is worth a thousand horses."
 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.13.t:0 "Megara"
 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.13.desc:0 "The plain north of Carthage has long been dotted with small estates and farmsteads, forming a suburban New City of sorts. Its lack of proper protection against the outside world and raiding Numidians, however, has prevented it from growing into true city. The new walls of Carthage, so recently completed and now enclosing the whole plain, are bound to change this and allow this suburb, Megara, to flourish.\n\nThe city's elite have set their sight on Megara, buying up property all over the plain to establish their villas and estates. As such the area is now rapidly being transformed into a garden city filled with olives groves and gardens full of fruit-bearing trees, divided off by low walls, hedges, and brambles."

With the lesser tribes of the interior it is still this way, but not in Carthage. Having to raise ever larger armies to defend against the rapacious Greeks of Sicily, we have had to resort to paying mercenaries in silver to bolster our armies. The use of silver coins has now crept into all aspects of life in Carthage, and the demand for the precious metal can never be satisfied.\n\nLuckily, our lands in Africa are rich in silver and our mines at Trisipensis have sent a large amount of talents ready for coining."

 cr_carthage_invasion_missions.19.desc:0 "Our city has been blessed with an excellent location - to dominate trade in the western Mediterranean - and two lagoons - forming excellent natural harbors for ships to shelter and unload their goods. Less blessed is the access to the lagoons: every storm throws up a new sandbar at the mouth of the lagoon, and keeping the channel connected the city to the sea open is a full time job.\n\nThe choma built along the seawall will greatly improve the situation. This massive stone structure covers the dangerous cliffs and allows ships to load and unload their cargoes directly from the sea, avoiding the need to pass through the narrow and treacherous channel into the lagoons."
