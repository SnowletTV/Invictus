 ### Aftermath of the Invasion ###
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission:0 "Aftermath of the Invasion"
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_DESCRIPTION:1 "Agathokles was beaten: his army destroyed at the Himera river, his city, Syracuse, besieged by our armies, his allies deserting him. We were the masters of Sicily. And then he did the unthinkable: with whatever he had left he crossed the sea and laid waste to our lands in Africa, finding support from both the Greeks from Cyrenaica as well as the Numidians living amongst us. Such was this disaster that we had to withdraw from Sicily to deal with him and lost our chance of dominating the Greeks of Sicily.\n"
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:1 "Agathokles' invasion of Africa still haunts our people."
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:1 "Before we can think to expand across the seas again, we must strengthen our grasp on our home. Or else we are doomed to repeat our mistake.\n\nThis mission cannot be restarted at a later date."
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_REWARD_DESCRIPTION:1 "We are prepared."
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_abort_tt:0 "This is a one time mission: aborting now will make impossible to restart at a later date."
 cr_carthage_mission_the_matter_of_aelymas_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We need to assert our dominance over the tribes before we can expand our city further."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_walls_of_carthage_DESC:0 "Carthage is connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus and can only be approached from a single direction. Fortifying and extending the walls across the isthmus will greatly improve the defenses of the city."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_megara:0 "Suburb of Megara"
 carthaginian_africa_invasion_megara_DESC:0 "Extending the walls not just across the isthmus, but also to encircle the plains on the peninsula north of the city, will greatly expand the size of the city. So much so that the land will not have to be filled with cramped urban dwellings to house all our people, but can instead house spacious villas and agricultural land.\n\nMegara will thus not just lead to an increase in the population of the city, but also secure a food supply in case of siege."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_elephant_pens_DESC:0 "The new walls of Carthage are massive, able to house 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. But their massive girth, 10 meters at the base, can also provide ample space for elephants to be housed for taming and training for war."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_citadel_of_vaga_DESC:0 "The ancient city of Vaga is well located to control movement into the fertile Bagradas valley. Increasing our presence there will prevent the Numidians from raiding our lands, as well as offer a firm base to extend our control further inland."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_altar_philaeni_DESC:0 "To prevent the eastern Greeks from invading our lands, a contest has been suggested to settle on a division of the two Syrtis: a pair of runners will depart from our territory, and a pair from Cyrenaica. The place where they will meet will be the demarcation point of our respective spheres of influence."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_charax_DESC:0 "Silphium is a valuable herb worth its weight in gold. Unfortunately, it is only known to grow in the mountains of Cyrenaica, and the Cyrenaicans jealously guard their monopoly on silphium. Though not jealously enough: on the sandy beaches of Greater Syrtis exists a lively trade in the herb between our and Cyrenaican traders.\n\nCharax has proven to be a favorite meeting spot of silphium smugglers. Should we invest in expanding operations there, we might be able to break the Cyrenaican silphium monopoly."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_choma_DESC:0 "A small channel through the lagoon connects our traders with the sea and the wider world. The narrow and treacherous nature of the channel, forcing ships to navigate multiple sandbanks, greatly hampers trade in the port. Building a choma, or quay, along the waterfront directly on the sea would greatly increase the number of ships able to conduct their trade in our port."

 ### Bomilcar's Revolution ###
 carthaginian_mission_bomilcars_revolution_DESCRIPTION:1 "Bomilcar treacherously tried to sacrifice the Sacred Band in battle to Agathokles, hoping to wipe out his opponents in the Hadirim and gain tyrannical power for himself. While he may have failed in his nefarious plan, many were led astray by his ideas and plans.\n\nMany of Bomilcar's disciples were pardoned, but there are still conflicts and disagreements lingering all across our nation."
