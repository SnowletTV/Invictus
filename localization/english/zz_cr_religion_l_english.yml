 cr_treasure_ambrosial_rock_gadir:0 "Ambrosial Rocks"
 cr_treasure_ambrosial_rock_gadir_desc:0 "A long time ago, so it is said, a pair of floating islands wandered above the surface of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nOn one of these islands stood a very strange sight: a burning olive tree, unconsumed by the flames.\n\nA closer look revealed a stranger sight still: an eagle perched atop the burning tree, and a snake wound around the tree's trunk. Neither animal, apparently, was harmed by the fire, nor did they have any desire to harm each other.\n\nThe Tyrians were instructed to sail after these floating islands by the god Melqart, who taught them the art of shipbuilding. After a long and perilous chase across the sea, these brave mariners managed to catch up with their quarry and scale the floating island with the burning olive tree. Then, following the orders of Melqart's oracle, they caught the eagle on top of the tree, and sacrificed it.\n\nThis eagle sacrifice ended the wandering of the islands and caused them to fall into the sea, where they remain to this day. This marked the foundation of the city of Tyre."

He then set them a quest to find the mythical #bold Ambrosial Rocks#! roaming the Mediterranean sea and perform a religious sacrifice to him.\n\nHaving caught up with these magical rocks, the brave sailors gazed upon an otherworldly sight: an olive tree engulfed in flames but not consumed by it. A closer look revealed an even stranger sight: an eagle and a snake lived in the tree, harmed by neither the flames nor each other.\n\nThe sacrifice of these animals would tie the rocks in their place allowing the city of #bold Tyre#! to be founded upon them.\n\nEver since then, a golden olive tree has decorated each of Melqart's temples."
