 diadochi_flavor.78.desc:0 "Established at the beginning of the fifth century BCE, Hellespontine Phrygia was ruled by descendants of Pharnaces, an uncle of King Darius I the Great, with its capital located at Dascylium. During the campaign of Alexander the Great in 334 BCE, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Arsites, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of the Granicus River, after which he committed suicide. Alexander appointed Calas as his successor. Following Alexander's death in 323 BCE, the satrapy was awarded to Leonnatus, a member of the royal house of Lyncestis in Macedonia and one of Alexander's trusted bodyguards. Alexander's sister Cleopatra, the widow of King Alexander I of Epirus, offered her hand in marriage to Leonnatus, a union that would have strengthened his claim to power. Had he defeated the Athenians, Leonnatus may very well have attempted to seize the Macedonian throne for himself. His career was cut short during the Lamian War, where he led a force of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to relieve Antipater during the siege of Lamia. Despite his likely ambitions to challenge Antipater's authority and potentially marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra, Leonnatus was killed in battle, leaving his aspirations unfulfilled.\n\nControl of the satrapy then passed to Arrhidaeus, who held it until the Partition of Triparadisus (321 BCE), after which Clitus the White was assigned as satrap. Clitus' rule was brief. He was defeated and killed in 317 BCE by Arrhidaeus. His successor, Ardys, governed for an uncertain period before power shifted again. Phoenix of Tenedos, a loyal subordinate of Antigonus, governed the region for a time, followed by Antigonos' nephew Polemaios, another of Antigonus' generals. However, after the compelled suicide of Polemaios, the satrapy has been defunct.\n\nNow control of Hellespontine Phrygia has fallen to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]. While we could follow Antigonus' example and simply absorb the satrapy, we have an opportunity to establish a new powerbase for our dynasty. [attalid_head.GetPraenomen]'s proposal for Asia to be ruled by a governor or even a king with strong local connections was inspired, but [attalid_head.GetPraenomen] was clearly not suited for such a task. [agathocles_scope.GetPraenomen] is incredibly popular with our Asian subjects and is undoubtedly one of our most adept administrators. [agathocles_scope.GetPraenomen] has always been a steadfast supporter of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen]. Since the blood of Alkimachus runs his veins, his loyalty to our dynasty is beyond question. Men claim that [agathocles_scope.GetPraenomen] conquered Hellespontine Phrygia nearly singlehandedly, driving out. And perhaps he did. Is not such a man deserving of the mantle of Leonnatus?"

By 316 BCE, Cyprus became a battleground between Ptolemaios and Antigonus for control over the Mediterranean. Alongside Nikokreon were three other loyal vassal kings: Nicokles of Paphos, Androkles of Amathus, and Pasikrates of Soli. The other kings of Cyprus allied with Antigonus. Ptolemaios's military intervention under the command of his brother Menelaos proved successful in quelling rebellious kings. In 312, Ptolemaios ousted all the Cypriot kings with the exception of Nikokreon of [GetProvince('(int32)331').GetName] (and perhaps Eunostos of [GetProvince('(int32)333').GetName]). Ptolemaios married his daughter Eirene to Eunostos shortly after Eunostos's father died to ensure that the new king of a leading Cypriot kingdom would remain loyal. Nikokreon's domains were greatly expanded; he was appointed as the chief Ptolemaic officer on the island and named the strategos of Cyprus.\n\nThough Nikokreon was favored by Ptolemaios, his death (potentially by compelled suicide) in 309 BCE led to a direct Ptolemaic administration of Cyprus and the abolishment of remaining independent Cypriot kingdoms. Ptolemaios's brother Menealos assumed Nikokreon's role; he was made king of [GetProvince('(int32)331').GetName] and Satrap of Cyprus."

Their words are formal and dutiful, but their pledge rings empty. [kition_guy.GetName] is the first to speak, reminding the new king of the need to maintain the loyalty of the old Cypriot elites.

 flavor_cyprus.11.desc:0 "Before the death of #E Perdikkas#! (321BC), [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen] had secured an alliance with Nikokreon, the most prominent of the Cypriot kings. By 316 BCE, Cyprus became a battleground between [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen] and #E Antigonus#! for control over the Mediterranean. Alongside #E Nikokreon#! were three other loyal vassal kings: #E Nicokles#! of Paphos, #E Androkles#! of Amathus, and #E Pasikrates#! of Soli. The other kings of Cyprus allied with Antigonus. [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen]'s military intervention under the command of his brother Menelaos proved successful in quelling rebellious kings. In 312 [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen] ousted all the Cypriot kings with the exception of Nikokreon of [GetProvince('(int32)331').GetName] (and perhaps Eunostos of [GetProvince('(int32)333').GetName]). [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen] married his daughter Eirene to Eunostos shortly after Eunostos's father died to ensure that the new king of a leading Cypriot kingdom would remain loyal. Nikokreon's domains were greatly expanded as he was given dominion over territories seized from kings loyal to the Antigonid cause. He was appointed as the chief Ptolemaic officer on the island and named the strategos of Cyprus.\n\nThough Nikokreon was favored by [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen], his death (potentially by compelled suicide) in 309 BCE led to a direct Ptolemaic administration of Cyprus and the abolishment of remaining independent Cypriot kingdoms. [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen]'s brother Menealos assumed Nikokreon's role; he was made king of [GetProvince('(int32)331').GetName] and Satrap of Cyprus.\n\nWith the rogue Cypriot kings defeated, peace has returned to Cyprus [menelaos_lagid.GetPraenomen] rules the east, with his seat in Salamis, while [eunostos_of_soloi.GetPraenomen] governs the west from Soloi. Both men have proven capable rulers in their own domains, yet each seeks to subjugate the whole of Cyprus...\n\n[menelaos_lagid.GetPraenomen], as the brother of [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetPraenomen] and a former Satrap of Cyprus, argues for the island's consolidation under his leadership. [eunostos_of_soloi.GetPraenomen], on the other hand, insists that the current division is fair and ensures peace by balancing power between the two rulers.

Surrounded by battering monsoons and chaotic waters, the Island of the Dioscuri is a land strange and alien to any other. It sports several endemic species, such as the dragon blood tree, whose prized sap was sought across continents for its medicinal properties. The Blessed Isle could facilitate trans-Erythraean trade between the Indoi and the Mediterranean peoples. Besides its myrrh, frankincense, tree sap, and aloe, the island is also renowned for its tortoise shells, for even the bellies of the tortoises there were thick enough to make tables out of. Though remote and thinly peopled, Dioskoridos is a place of immense promise and could become a linchpin in the great Erythraean trade routes.
