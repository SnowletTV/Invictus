 aeneas.1.a:0 "We all know Hektor was the better man."
 aeneas.1.desc:0 "As Aeneas fled from the ruins of Ilium, so we make our way westward to start anew. The dream of my father has not died with him. The faithful ones have returned from the field and are rallying to our cause. In the West sits Kassandros, the unrightful ruler of Macedonia and murderer of Alexandros' heir. The line of Antigonos was born to reign and there will be a day when this sea shall be ours."

 aeneas.3.desc:0 "It appears that the quick death of Basileus Philippos IV following his father Kassandros has brought a crisis upon the Antipatrid house.

 aeneas.6.a:0 "I AM, by Dios, the rightful heir of the Argeads."
 aeneas.6.desc:0 "After disposing of Alexander, the people are left with Antipatros. Perhaps it was too much matricide for them, because the Macedonia army seems to have joined our ranks and has offered the throne to us instead."

 aeneas.7.a:0 "I hear that the Corinthian courtesans are just as nice as the Athenian ones..."
 aeneas.7.desc:0 "Now that the heirs of Antigonus are the undisputed rulers of Macedon, there is little argument to by made by our southern neighbors against our rule. They have offered their submission willingly."

 aeneas.8.a:0 ".. and Plato said that monarchy is the best form of government."
 aeneas.8.b:0 "Out of respect for the philosophers, let their city be free."
 aeneas.8.desc:0 "The Athenians have sent envoys stating that they would rather be 'free' than live under our role and are willing to stake their lives on it.
