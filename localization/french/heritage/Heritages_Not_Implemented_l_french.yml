 fezzani_heritage:0 "Fezzani Heritage"
 fezzani_heritage_desc:0 "The tribes of the Fezzan were masters of desert combat and tamers of the numerous oases of Libya. While they struggle against properly trained legions in open field, their desert guerilla fighting and use of more mobile units presented an everlasting challenge to Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans alike."
 macrobian_heritage:0 "Somali Heritage"
 macrobian_heritage_desc:0 "What the peoples of modern Somalia lacked in land warfare they made up for tremendously at sea. They were prolific traders of exotic goods, pirates and coastal raiders, taking advantage of those with inferior seamanship. Their trade network extended from India to the Mediterranean, and down the eastern coast of Africa, giving them diplomatic contacts across the known world."

 tartessian_heritage_desc:0 "Many centuries ago Tartessos was one of the most important commercial and political centers of Iberia. A heritage that lives on to this day, even if the tribes that dominate the area would largely be foreign to the old Tartessians."
