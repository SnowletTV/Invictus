 destroy_jerusalem_temple_desc:0 "Long ago the forefathers of the Judaeans to our South chose, against God's will, to relocate the tabernacle to their lands. Uzzi hid the tent of the congregation in a cave on the holy Mount Gerizim where it miraculously vanished, stopping their plans. Undeterred, they built a heretical temple to replace it on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. Now that we control the city, it is time we tore down this false altar that Mount Gerizim will once again be recognized as the sole location ordained for the worship of God."
