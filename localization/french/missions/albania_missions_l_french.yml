 01_albania: "Albanian Greatness"
 01_albania_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Thus begins our ascent to glory - we shall embrace our destiny!"
 01_albania_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed after #E Albania#! has finished building up her economy and infrastructure to an exacting standard of greatness, one that is worthy of the glorious Albanian nation."
 01_albania_DESCRIPTION: "Ages ago, when the world was young and the gods walked the face of the Earth, the warrior #E Arhan#! once traversed through the #E Caucasus Mountains#! on his way to the vast steppes, and where his footsteps touched the ground, there our people remained and stayed.\n\nWe are the Sons of Arhan, the genial #E Albanians#!, for our reputation as a good-natured and peaceful people is a well-deserved one - perhaps to our shame, for we were once unable to resist the #E Achaemenids#!, who mettled in our internal affairs with a brazen contempt for our sovereignty that was humiliating.\n\nBut times have changed, and they are no more and here we stand. We find ourselves at a crossroads; shall we embrace our native roots or pursue after the #E Achaemenid#! tradition?"
 01_albania_task_10: "The Eastern Caucasian Tribes"
 01_albania_task_10_DESC: "The Lezgi people, like we Albanians, have long taken shelter within the shadow of the Caucasian Mountains and have existed in isolation. While it may be difficult to organize them, it should be our benefit to unite as brothers, sons of the mountains. We are stronger together! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"
 01_albania_task_11: "The Albanian Sea"
 01_albania_task_11_DESC: "Mountains, plains, horses, mines... these are familiar to us. Water. Water is familiar only in the mountain streams and rivers. Yet we know that riches come from afar, and the sea is the quickest path. With our contacts amongst the Lezgi informing us that the tribes beyond our view have no strong hold over the coastline, perhaps we could take advantage of this. "
 01_albania_task_12: "A Distant Chorasmian Threat"
 01_albania_task_12_DESC: "It is no secret that the kings of Chorasmia have had their eyes on our lands, hoping to subjugate the entirety of the northern, eastern, and western stretches along the Mazandaran (Hyrcanian) sea. Their king is even said to have begged #T Alexander the Great#! to support him in his ambitions, with the sly promise of giving our land to the Greeks.\n\nNow that we control the waterways and the shores, it ought to be our turn to threaten their lands and harvest their well-watered crops. Assaulting the so-called 'Fifty-Fortress Oasis' will be a most glorious achievement for our people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil22!"
 01_albania_task_13: "The Achaemenid Remnant"
 01_albania_task_13_DESC: "It has not been so long that our people have forgotten the armies, builders, and bureaucrats of the Persians and their Achaemenid rulers in the past. Among our lands, there still remain many relics of their footprint. Among them, a great palace, nigh, a capital of the satrapy, remains dormant and in ruines along the river banks. Why should the Albanians not seize this chance to take the place of power which the Achaemenids once did in this region. Their rule was long, presperous, and perhaps we may yet do better..."
 01_albania_task_14: "Achaemenid-Style Governance"
 01_albania_task_14_DESC: "In order to command the respect and fear the Achaemenids once held, we must replicate their autonomy-granting yet communicative and regal means of government - that same method of control which they once held over us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil5!"
 01_albania_task_15: "Iranian Gods"
 01_albania_task_15_DESC: "Many gods inhabit this world. Those of the mountains have watched over us longer than time can recall. Yet, if we are to rule the new dawn in the image of greater kings, perhaps the assistance of new gods will help bring about our new age. There are those beings worshipped by the Medes, our first conquerers of memory, whom the Persians too worshipped, though they deny it. Then, there is Ahura Mazda and his all-knowing cabal of brethren and underlings, whom Darius made known to us and whome the Persians to this day hold most dear. It is doubtless that all of these immortals hold power over the dusty plains to the south, if not beyond..."
 01_albania_task_16: "Albanian-Iranian Arms"
 01_albania_task_16_DESC: "All of the enemies of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes feared the endless armies under the Achaemenid standard. They feared the elite 'Immortals' even more. Some even believed them to truly be undying even in the fiercest battles. If only we could produce and utilize a single drop of that aweful power. Perhaps a combination of their old ways with our flexible mountainous and plains tactics may provide a versatile fighting force. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil9!"
 01_albania_task_17: "Palace Centers"
 01_albania_task_17_DESC: "The Achaemenids once ruled from many palaces and other grand seats in our mountain domain. If we are to truly be the civilizers of the north, we must reassert out dominance through a replication of their glory. Let us rebuild and repopulate the throne-rooms of old, where untold knowledge and prestige awaits us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"
 01_albania_task_18: "Securing The Achaemenid North"

 01_albania_task_19: "Albanian Satrapies"
 01_albania_task_19_DESC: "In order to secure the legacy of the Achaemenids, our Albanian authorities ought to enact the same system of semi-autonomous government for satrapies like we outselves once were. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"
 01_albania_task_1: "The Sons Of Arhan"
 01_albania_task_1_DESC: "Our ancient stories speak of a #E Great Flood#!, and when the waters had finally receded from the face of the Earth, our progenitor, the mighty warrior #E Arhan#!, traveled far until he reached the mountainous lands that our people and neighbors inhabit.\n\nDo the #E Albanian#! tribes remember their shared history? Could this spark from yesteryear be enough to kindle the flames of rebirth for the Albanian nation? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 01_albania_task_20: "An Albanian Empire"
 01_albania_task_20_DESC: "In the footsteps of the Medes, the Achaemenids, and the Macedonians, the Albanians must use their terrirorial achievements in order to claim the glory and political control that comes with imperial rule. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil7!"
 01_albania_task_21: "A Step On The Road Of Trade"
 01_albania_task_21_DESC: "While the Casucasian Mts. and the Hyrcanian Sea bound it geographically, they also funnel eurasian trade through the whole lenght of Caucasian Alabania, east to west and north to south. The people ought to harness their natural position and leverage it for the economic benefit of their lands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil27!"
 01_albania_task_22: "Hyrcanian Sea Trade"
 01_albania_task_22_DESC: "An ocean in of itself, the Hyrcanian Sea maybe be encircled by raiding parties of nomads, but, it does serve to connect the vast markets of the east with their buyers in the west. Should the Albanians not do as the Hyrcanians to the south and take charge of the waters even if the mountains and valleys are their natural home? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 01_albania_task_23: "A Capital In Khabala"
 01_albania_task_23_DESC: "If people are to remember us long after our days are numbered, a great city will be required to house our legacy, if at least in name. Our strongest tribes and even the people before us have held Khabala to be a powerful perch from which to survey the land below and the roads leading in and out of our domain. Let us make this the perfect spot from which to wield our strength in both diplomacy and war. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"
 01_albania_task_24: "Albanian Steeds"
 01_albania_task_24_DESC: "As the Kura and Arax rivers join and, together, empty into the great Hyrcanian sea, they create a most fertile land. The steeds of the northern steppe were brought here long ago and they have prospered in the far-off fields. We would do well to adopt the powerful swiftness which the northern horselords wield, and use these beasts for our own purposes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil13!"
 01_albania_task_25: "The Caspians"
 01_albania_task_25_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been of two minds when considering the status of the #Y Caspians#! that live within the borders of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nDiametrically opposed arguments have been made, and both have their merits; should they be welcomed into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society, with all of the rights and privileges that our people enjoy, or should they be locked in fetters and sent to plow our fields? Or perhaps their status should be reduced to tribesmen...there is an important decision to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil17!"
 01_albania_task_26: "Defending The Darband Pass"
 01_albania_task_26_DESC: "One of, if not the most famous, gates of the Caucasus, the Darband Pass has been feared by many a great empire. While steppe hords have actually been noted for crossing into the Iranian Plateau via the Parthian 'Gates,' the Medes, Achaemenids, and other empires feared a nomadic incursion across the Caucasus for ages. However, they somehow could not realize the potential of controlling such an important trading waystation which bridges two distinct worlds. Let us protect ourselves and become the best of traders and tax-collectors.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 01_albania_task_27: "A Growing Population"

 01_albania_task_28: "Trade From The Steppes"
 01_albania_task_28_DESC: "The horselords to the north, often harbingers of violence and invasion, have also proven to be the best of craftsmen and the most skilled of workers, barterers, and vessels for trade. It would not be the worst decision to find common ground with some of their kind on one occassion or other. There is no telling what benefits we might find with these wily people as allies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil6!"

 01_albania_task_2: "Albanian Lands"
 01_albania_task_2_DESC: "While fluid in nature, the boundaries of what can be called 'Albania' have stretched far and wide in times past. It would be in our best interest to once again lay claim to take up those lands and old forts once again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

We live in a 'tough neighborhood', so to speak, so providing security for those that would visit the markets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and other hubs is a high priority.
