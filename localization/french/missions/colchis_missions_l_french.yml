A trusted advisor to the high priest has come forth bearing a remarkable thing. It has caused disbelief in the court. In his hands, he held a ram's fleece... so golden, so shining, so glorious in its coloration that it could have only been divine. Yet, there was one patch missing in the display.\n\nGrabbing the strand we aquaired from the Greeks at Phasis, he put it to that same patch, without prompting, and displayed a complete masterpiece - it was as if the strand had vanished, and confirmed that the fleece was genuine. Some belive the gods presented a lone farmer with a golden ram so that another fleece could belong to Kolchis, others believe the old relic had simply made its way back home from Thessalian shores, so the stories and rumors go..."

 colchis_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when Colchis has both restored the honor and legacy of Aeetes and has conquered the Pontos Euxinos."
 colchis_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The history of fabled Kolchis dates back to the time of legend, when old Aeetes ruled the lands newly established along the Phasis river. Having given away his Corinthian holdings, Aeetes ruled this foreign place as a master of magics and established a rich and desireable kingdom among the marshes and forests of the western Caucasus. \n\nFirst mentioned by the Assyrians as Qulha, Kolchis has fallen into unity and disarray multiple times, fragmenting into kinglets and then rejoining into one great state of the Phasis basin in cyclical patterns. The natural geography of the land made Colchis a bountiful land, but also doomed it to natural beauty with a lack of truly industrial capacity - never could the throne of Aea/Kutaisi compete with the likes of established kingdoms in Hellas, Anatolia, or the Iranian Plateau. \n\nColchis remained on the periphery of the known world, hidden at the end of the 'Hospitable Sea,' only known as such after Greek exploration and colonization, until the Achaemenid Empire brushed upon its borders after incorporating neighboring Caucasian Iberia into the satrapy system. From that point on, Colchis' merchants, markets, and administration became far more entwined with the Mediterranean and the Aegean, but it remained a purely Black Sea power. Perhaps it is now time for old Aeetes' stomping grounds to outgrow its cradle and explore the options which the world has in store."
 colchis_missions_REWARD_DESCRIPTION:0 "Colchis will gain military and economic abilities which outmatch the likes of the Mediterranean powers to the south."

Famous for its salt deposits, Dioscurias' markets are so diverse and expansive that it is said that 70 to 300 unique languages can be heard while wandering the town in a day. The Colchians must obtain greater benefits from Dioscurias' natural advantages."

 colchis_missions_task_02_DESC:0 "Built atop vast limestone deposits and on a defensible hilly area at the edge of the plains, Tsikhegoji, known to the Greeks as Archaeopolis, sat at a great crossroads of trade and directly profited from the jewel and precious metal mines found within the mountains overlooking it. Thus, it was both a strategic and presitigous place for a fort - but perhaps we can create a more fitting castle for the one who occupies the Colchian throne."
 colchis_missions_task_03:0 "The Golden River"
 colchis_missions_task_03_DESC:0 "The Phasis, named for the glittering nuggets which hide among the rocks and pebbles below, is the lifeline of trade and communication from our capital to the greater Pontos. We must control it and utilize it as the true arm of our economy."

 colchis_missions_task_05_DESC:0 "Situated on an open plain, Vardtsikhe, known to the Greeks as Rhodopolis or the City of the Rose, is a bountiful but vulnerable flower of civilization. Should enemies come like a horde, passing down through mountain passes like avalanches, it must be prepared and protected, else the flower will droop and wither."
 colchis_missions_task_06:0 "Drain the Swamps"
 colchis_missions_task_06_DESC:0 "Many have said that the kingdom and people of Colchis has been held back most by its natural landscape. While the Colchians are accustomed to navigating canal webs and traversing marshy terrain in order to get goods to and from the markets inland and at the coast, if the land were to be drained of this sometimes detrimental feature, then cities could expand and more roads could be built to expand trade lanes and the ability to grow the industrial sector."
 colchis_missions_task_07:0 "The Indo-Euxinos Trade"
 colchis_missions_task_07_DESC:0 "While the Iranian Plateau has always served as one main route of trade, the Pontos Euxinos and Mazandaran Sea have also seen alternate routes for cheap naval transportation that feeds into the bosporan straight and then the rich Aegean. Building up the infrastructure along the Phasis river should allow Colchian merchants to have better and faster access to far-off goods."

 colchis_missions_task_08_DESC:0 "While the Colchians have long kept to their coastal waters and the safety of their side of the mountain passes, there is no disputing the fact that the inner Southern Caucasus has a greater wealth of mineral resources and access to trade with the steppe peoples to the north via the central Caucasian Gate. Uniting the houses of Aeetes and Pharnavazd could lead to a great regional power system."

A system of royal governors, ruling out of all the major cities and settlements in the Phasis delta and beyond should help maintain the day-to-day order of things, wielding the ceremonial staffs of the king."
 colchis_missions_task_10:0 "The Palace of Aeetes"
 colchis_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "While no person in all of Colchis cannot recite the tale of Aeetes and the Argonauts who defeated him, not to mention his sorceress daughter, Medea, few can look across the land and point to where the old king lived. There lies an old and forgotten ruin near the outer edges of the town of Phasis. The throne's advisors believe these overgrown and swamp-ridden relics of the past to be the few remaining features of an ancient palace - that same palace where Aeetes sat on his throne and ruled one of the most powerful kingdoms of the legendary past. To reclaim our heritage and once again take on the mantel of the rich trading hub of the seas, we must restore that place's old glory."

 colchis_missions_task_11:0 "The Eastern Hospitable Coast"
 colchis_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The Pontos Euxinos has only become known as such due to the frequency and wealth of trade that has permeated the sea and its coast. While Colchis' position in the east has allowed for Transcaucasian and Caspian trade to come from the east, controlling greater swathes of the northern and southern coasts will allow for an expansion into Steppe, Taurican, and Anatolian markets. Colchis will also have greater naval control in the local waters, able to stave off piracy and serious competition."
 colchis_missions_task_12:0 "Inspired Administration"
 colchis_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The 19th Achaemenid Satrapy once encompassed the lower border-regions of Colchis. While they were, at times, aggressive and intrusive, the Persians to the south were well-known for being incredibly orderly and prepared for any sort of administrative hurdle, politically or socially. With the king's power stretched between many royal governors amongst the major cities, the ability to control affairs centrally and efficiently has been left in the hand of supposedly-loyal handlers. Were the court of Colchis to take inspiration from the Achaemenid manner of communication, routine checking, and cultural awareness, maintaining the loyalty and effectiveness of these skeptoukhi may be a much simpler task than previously imagined."

 colchis_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The Bosporos and Cimmerian straights control and limit the shipping that travels in and out of the Pontos Euxinos to the north and south. While Colchis has always benefitted from trade heading northwards through these, there is so much lost potential from not controlling them and their taxation directly. The Bosporos and Cimmerian Bosporos are monopolies on violence - to control them, the navies and merchants of Colchis must own them...utterly."
 colchis_missions_task_14:0 "Hegemon of the Pontos Euxinos"
 colchis_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "Economically and politically, Colchis can become an unconquerable power if it were to control the entire Pontos Euxinos, being the sole decider in shipping, personel traffic, and military affairs.
