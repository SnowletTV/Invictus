When questioned, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] wistfully recalls a time when the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] knew the Garamantic tribes intimately, and even though we did not see eye to eye all of the time, we considered them blood relations, sharers in our way of life.\n\nBut the last tribe of Garamantia has been destroyed forever, and the future remains unknowable..."

They claim they are more interested in expanding in #E Iberia#! than our deserts, and as a token of their goodwill, have agreed to become our allies! They hope that this will assuage our fears of a Punic invasion."
