persis_mission_1_freedom:0 "Persian Pursuits"
persis_mission_1_freedom_DESCRIPTION:0 "The history of the region of Persis is rich and varied; a tale that seemingly grows with every retelling. It was this region that gave birth to the Achaemenids, who brought the light of civilization to the world before suffering the ignominy of defeat by Macedonian barbarians. Those who think the best days of Persis are behind her have not been paying attention to the omens; the gods have much in store for us."
persis_mission_1_freedom_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have expelled the foreign interlopers from our homelands and have reestablished the might of Persis!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_1:0 "Restore Persepolis"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_1_DESC:0 "The barbarians destroyed Persepolis in a drunken stupor, burning it to ash; they might have destroyed the city, but the dream cannot be extinguished. Today, we make our visions into reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil5!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_2:0 "Reach Out to the Uxii"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_2_DESC:0 "There are many connections between our people and the Uxians; we share so many religious and cultural practices that many foreigners cannot distinguish our peoples. It behooves us to reforge these ancient bonds yet again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil1!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_3:0 "Find Allies"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_3_DESC:0 "Our dreams are big and bold, perhaps too large for us to pursue in our current state...it would be wise for us to find allies where we may. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_4:0 "Urbanize Suravan"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_4_DESC:0 "As it stands, the capital of our province of Mardiene is not worthy of the honor, being nothing more than a mere settlement. We have lofty plans for this region, so we should make all efforts to urbanize Suravan when we can. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic11!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_5:0 "Beautify Batrakatash"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_5_DESC:0 "When one leaves Parsa, following the Royal Road to the north, the imposing mountain city of Batrakatash is less than a few week's ride. While we rely on the city's fortifications to protect our capital, we could take steps to make this a center of culture as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_6:0 "Expand Kazerun"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_6_DESC:0 "The strength of our cities is directly tied to our prospects for independence; we cannot neglect anything, else we openly court disaster. Considering its importance to our efforts, Kazerun should be expanded! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil8!"

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_7:0 "Restore Heartland Economy"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_7_DESC:0 "Gold is the oil that lubricates the engines of war, and we must ensure that our heartland can sustain the immense economic pressures that we are about to place upon it. The time has come to buttress our financial resources. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19! "

persis_mission_1_freedom_task_8:0 "Connect Kish"
persis_mission_1_freedom_task_8_DESC:0 "The valuable port of Kish is our window to the Sinus Persicus; every day ships from Bushahr sail south to our outpost on the coast. It has been suggested that we extend the Royal Road to this city, so that we are not entirely reliant upon our navies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@persia_mil3!"

me_persis_1_desc:0 "When we remember the beauty of the city of Persepolis, of its shaded streets and fragrant gardens that delighted the soul, our eyes fill with tears of bitterness and rage when we consider its present state. Those Macedonian barbarians thought they could erase our heritage with fire and death, but their atrocities have only solidified our desire to restore Persepolis. The time has come to restore our ancient glory, and the world will know that Persis sleeps no more."

Drawing upon these sweet memories, we have sent an envoy to our friends the Uxians, asking them to remember their vows of old. You will be pleased, o [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], to hear that they are faithful and have not forgotten their oaths."

Despite these threats, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] gave the order, and we were successful in our goals. Our preparations continue..."
