While many cultures once had a similar tradition, only some Italic peoples still celebrate and go through with it to this day. \n\nWhen a sacred spring is called, all the young children and cattle that are born in the spring of the following year will be 'devoted' to this rite and are considered to be under divine protection. Once they have reached maturity, they will be required to leave their community and are expected to create a new settlement, either by subjugating or exterminating the previous inhabitants or simply by settling uncolonized land. \nSome people think that originally, the 'devoted' children and cattle would be sacrificed.\n\nThe Roman practice of devotio is most likely related to the Ver Sacrum."
