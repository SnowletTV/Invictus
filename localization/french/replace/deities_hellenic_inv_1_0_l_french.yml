 omen_aeetes:0 "Aeetes"
 omen_aeetes_desc:0 "The son of the Sun god Helios and the Oceanid (water nymph) Perseis, Aeëtes was the king of the Colchis in Greek mythology. He featured prominently in the incredble story of Iason and the Argonauts, in which Aeëtes promised Iason the legendary Golden Fleece if Iason was able to complete certain tasks. Aeëtes also may have been a real figure in history, or perhaps a representation of a real historical king. Many Colchian rulers claim descendency from this semi-mythical figure."

 omen_apsyrtus_desc:0 "A Colchian prince and descendant of Helios, Apsyrtus was integral in Jason and the Argonauts' story. He and his sister, Medea, would flee with Jason away from Colchis with the legendary golden fleece. However, Medea, in order to slow her father who would have caught up to her, kills Apsyrtus and throws his body parts behind her so that her father would be compelled to collect all the pieces of his son, thus slowing him down."

A giant, watchful serpent, the drakon was the sacred protector of the grove which the Greeks say belonged to Ares. From its teeth, sown in the ground, sprung fierce, battle-hardened warriors ready to fight to the bitter end. It was a terrible yet awesome creature with a singular purpose designed by the gods."
 omen_ge:0 "Ge"
 omen_ge_desc:0 "Ge is the Armazic depiction of the Greek deity Gaia. One of four original immortal beings to be sprung fourth after Khaos, she was the embodiment of the earth itself. She would create Ouranos, the heavens, before bringing forth more children. Ourea, the mountains; Pontos, the sea; and the Cyclopes; all without aid of a consort. Ouranos would become her first consort. From this union, Ge grew pregnant with three boys. However, Ouranos, in fear of his position, refused to allow the children to be born. Thus, Ge would suffer immensely as Ouranos would prevent her from giving birth. Finally, Kronos would help her get revenge on Ouranos by cutting off his male member. From this many beings were born: Erinys, the giants, Nymphs of the Ash tree (Meliae), and from the majority of the flesh arose the goddess Aphrodite. Finally, the children within Ge were born as the Titans Briareos, Kottos, and Gyes."
 omen_hylaian_drakaina_desc:0 "$drakaina_description$\n\n#Y Drakaina#!: A half-snake half-woman like the other Drakaina from Greek myth, the Hylaian Drakaina serves as a representation of the fertile earth. In an effort to explain the Scythian traditional origin myth from their own perspective, the Greeks used her to convey the idea of the land giving birth to the three great sons of Herakles who would go on to populate the land of Scythia."
 omen_iason:0 "Iason"
 omen_iason_desc:0 "Iason is an ancient Greek hero and the leader of the Argonauts. Iason put together a crew for his ship, the Argo, which included many Greek heroes including Heracles, the Dioscuri, Argus, Orpheus, and many more prominent figures. They aimed to find the legendary Golden Fleece and thus set out on adventure. First to the isle of Lemnos, in which all men but Heracles partook in many affairs with the local women resulting in a new 'race' of the Minyae. Next they ventured to Cyzicus, where they would run into a surprise attack from the earthborn giants called Gegeines. Then, Iason and the Argonauts set sail towards the court of Phineus where they were attacked by harpies. Finally, in order to reach Colchis, they sailed through the treacherous Symplegades, which were crushing and clashing cliffs that targetted anything traveling through them. Finally, they arrived at Colchis where they would have to face against Aeëtes and his impossible trials to be granted the Golden Fleece."
 omen_leukothea:0 "Leukothea"
 omen_leukothea_desc:0 "Leukothea, or Leukothoe, was a goddess with many slightly differing origin myths. In one version, she was Athamas' queen who was then called Ino. Hera would drive Ino insane as punishment for caring after the newborn god Dionysus. Ino leapt into the sea with her son Melicertes in her arm. Out of pity, the gods transformed the two into gods of the sea. Ino became Leukothea and her son became Palaemon.\n\nIn a version of the myth from Rhodes regards Halia, a nymph (or minor goddess). She was the daughter of the titans Thalassa and Pontus. Halia would become the wife of Poseidon and the union birthed the pair six sons as well as the goddess Rhodos. However, the sons denied Aphrodite to land on their island, and so she cursed the sons who would sexually assault their own mother, Halia. In despair, Halia plunged herself into the ocean and became Leukothea."
 omen_phrixus:0 "Phrixus"
 omen_phrixus_desc:0 "Phrixus was the son of the king of Boeotia, Athamas. His mother was the goddess of clouds, Nephele. Phrixus was, along with his twin Helle, to be sacrificed in order to save the crops of Boetia. Their stepmother, Ino (later the goddess Leucothea), hated them and so roasteed all the seeds of grain in Boetia secretly. The farmers would ask the oracle what had happened and what to do, however, the men who were to deliver the oracle's words were bribed by Ino to lie and tell the rest of the Boetians that the oracle claimed Phrixus and Helle should be sacrificed. Before they could be sacrificed though, they were saved by a swimming ram with the golden fleece. Unfortunately, during the travels on the ram, Helles would fall off and be cast into the waters that would henceforth be called the Hellespont. Meanwhile, Phrixus would go on to Colchis where he was treated well by the King Aeëtes and even married Aeëtes daughter, Chalciope. Their union bore Argus, Phrontis, Melas, and Cytisorus."
 omen_prometheus:0 "Prometheus"
 omen_prometheus_desc:0 "Prometheus, the greek Titan of fire. Prometheus famously defied the Greek gods by giving humanity the secret to fire. He was heralded as a great deity for humanity, gifting them not only fire, but the essence of technological advancement and civilization. However, because he defied the gods, Prometheus was punished for eternity. He was bound to a giant rock at a mountain at the edge of Colchis. There, an eagle would come to eat his liver from his body every day. Every night his liver would grow back, only to be eaten again by the eagle."
