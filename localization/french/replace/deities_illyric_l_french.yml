Menzanas is a native Messapian god of the horses not found in other cultures, but he was frequently paired as an epithet with other deities to show their might or power."
 omen_taotor:1 "Taotor"
 omen_taotor_desc:3 "A mysterious goddess, Taotor is not well known at all. Etymology suggests she was some kind of goddess of the people, Teuta(na) being the Illyrian word for mistress of the people, or even Queen (famously used in the name of Queen Teuta). Other related etymologies in Celtic, Italic, and Gothic words all seem to imply the same: a word associated with tribal unity or of people in general. Thus, it can be at least concluded that Taotor is a goddess of the people."
