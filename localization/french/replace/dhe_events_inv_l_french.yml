We have been driven by generations of oppression, and now seek to reclaim our freedom and honor once and for all. As the siege of Carthage commenced, our generals led the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] forces with unwavering determination. The battle was fierce, with both sides fighting desperately for their cause.\n\nThe walls of Carthage stood strong, but our horned warriors were relentless. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] strategic brilliance and the indomitable spirit of our warriors slowly chipped away at the city's defenses. Amidst the chaos of the battle, a daring plan emerged. Under the cover of night, a group of valiant Punic-speaking scouts infiltrated the city, sabotaging Carthage's supply lines and morale - we have used their language against them.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, our steadfast efforts began to yield fruit and the Carthaginian resistance started to crumble beneath our feet. At the apogee of the battle, our leadership inspired the soldiers with the hallowed war cries of our people, recalling the memories of old with these ancient chants and forging an unbreakable bond that would determine the outcome of the siege. The decisive day arrived when the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s breached Carthage's walls, unleashing a wave of triumph in the name of our ancestors and our sole God.\n\nNow it is up to our wise [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] to choose the fate of our enemy of old - shall we foolishly leave them untouched, filling our hearts with a feeling of injustice, or shall we reclaim the honor of our ancestors? Our people, our navy, and our army have faith in whatever decision [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] makes, but we cannot disappoint them."
