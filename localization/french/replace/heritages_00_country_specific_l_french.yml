 gordyene_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Karduchoi"
 gordyene_heritage_desc:0 "First noted as the Qardu tibal folk by the Urartian and and Assyrian kingdoms of the Archaic Period, the Karduchoi exist as an enigma in the region by the time of the Diadochi. A Caucasian-like people who are said to still, in part, worship the old Hurrian gods, the Karduchoi at times pay fealty and tribute to empires and, at other times, are their biggest fears. Seen as ferociously war-like mountain-men, armies were said to completely disappear after entering their homeland. Despite their primitive depiction by neighbors, the Karduchoi were notable for building complex cities, citadels, and capable weapons of war such as siege equipment. Their workshops were run by master craftsmen who could create the most alluring wares."

 mannaean_heritage_desc:0 "To their west, they battled the likes of the Urartian kingdom. To their north, the Scytho-Cimmerian hordes threatened their very existence. To their east, the Medes and predatory Iranian tribes raided their border village. And to the south, the Neo-Assyrian Empire threatened vassalization. It is no wonder that, holed up in their Matienian homeland of moutnains and the lake, they built forts to keep foreigners out and proctect themselves the best they could. Within the Ziwiyeh fort, their prayers to Teshub and the god's kind awarded their salvation...for a time. It is time for their throne to once again be a seat of power."

 matiene_heritage_desc:0 "Having emerged out of the wreckage of the Mannaean Kingdom, the Matieni took up the fortress of Ziwiyeh, south of the lake Matiene named for them, and sought to create a barrier to the horde-like Scythians to the north and the nomadic Iranians to the east. Speaking a Hurro-Urartian language, the Matieni worshiped the Hurrian god Teshub and the others of the Hurrian pantheon."

 subartu_heritage_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Subartu, found somewhere in the north of Mesopotamia along the Tigris, near the lands of Lake Van and the Urartians, was known best as the place where everyone's goods and slaves were going. Letters to and from the leaders of Mesopotamia and Egypt speak of this place as the destinarion of gold, slaves, and wares of luxuries quality. While the Subari people eventually fell under the domain and influence of the ancient Mitanni Kingdom, they maintained a Tigritic heritage and used the rich waterway as a means of facilitating their own growth and sustainment even through the subjugation and decay of the Mitanni."
 veneto_heritage_desc:0 "It cannot be confirmed, but many scholars, both ancient and modern, have come to a general conclusion that the name ‘Veneti’ may have come from the idea of ‘passion’ or ‘grace.’ These passionate people spoke a language called Venetic that, while containing large similarities to Latin and other Italic languages, maintained elements of Germanic and Celtic speech. Herodotus, confused as he may have been, claimed that the marriage customs of these people, whom he both claimed to have been of Veneto and in other cases of Illyria, mirrored that of the Babylonians. Others have come to the legendary conclusion that the Veneti were in fact Anatolian in origin, being from Paphlagonia, and were simply led west to the coast of the Adriatic Sea by the Trojan prince Antenor following the end of the great 10-year war in the kingdom of Prium. The Veneti are then, supposedly, Paphlagonians and Trojans who merged with the native Euganei tribe of the region. However famous this supposed exodus was, the Greeks seemed to have viewed the Veneti as being most famous for their horses, for which the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse founded trading colonies along the Venetian coast in order to acquire - he specifically adored the town of Adria for trade, aiding in its construction of canals so as to break the monopoly the city of Spina held over the sea. For their own part, the Veneti maintained peace along their borders with friendly relationships among the other Celts."
