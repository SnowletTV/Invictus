 iberian_starting_country_events.crm.desc:0 "Inland Turdetania, near the [GetProvince('(int32)7772').GetName] River, is where the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1374').GetName] is located. This city once lived a quiet life, living off the trade and specializing in metallurgy, but the political instability that devastated Turdetania after the fall of #E Tartessos#! changed the [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective]s.\n\nThe mastery of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] in the use of metals gave its army an advantage over its neighbors. The [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] army won many wars against [GetProvince('(int32)1371').GetName], the other great Turdetanian city of the region, which will hopefully one day culminate in a conquest. Hopefully, the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1369').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1372').GetName] will suffer the same fate - if the gods see fit to reward us.\n\nThe recent expansion have drawn the attention of other Turdetanians. They see [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] as a threat. [GetCountry('ASA').GetName] also seeks to become the hegemon of the region and will try to prevent further [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] expansion. This has created a very tense climate that only time will fix."

 iberian_starting_country_events.onu.desc:0 "The coastal city of [GetProvince('(int32)1339').GetName] has been inhabited since immemorial times. Positioned on a peninsula at the mouth of the Luxia River, [GetProvince('(int32)1339').GetName] benefices from a defendable location as well as controlling the commerce of the metals extracted from the rich mines of [GetProvince('(int32)1415').GetName].\n\nAlthough the previously wealthy mines of [GetProvince('(int32)1415').GetName] are starting to get depleted by heavy exploitation since Tartessian times, a good management can avoid an economic disaster for [GetCountry('ONU').GetName], or perhaps even revitalize the mines.\n\nPhoenician settlers have been arriving in waves since the first travels beyond the Pillars of Herakles, but Punic migration has increased since the [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective] expansion into Iberia. Two centuries ago, during the collapse of  #E Tartessos#!, Celtic tribes moved from the Central Plateau to the lands called [GetCountry('BDL').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1337').GetArea.GetName]. Now, as well as Punics, Celtician settlers are migrating to [GetCountry('ONU').GetName].\n\nNot located around the [GetProvince('(int32)7771').GetName] River, [GetCountry('ONU').GetName] is not involved on the struggle between [GetCountry('ASA').GetName] and [GetCountry('CRM').GetName], but that doesn't mean the result won't affect them."

 iberian_starting_country_events.tut.desc:0 "The land of the Turdetanians had many names in the past; the most widely used was  #E Tartessos#!. This state is a mixture of myth and reality, and legends talk about the riches and prosperity of the kingdom ruled by the Silver Man himself, Arganthonios.\n\nPhoenicians and Greeks have tried to colonize the area since the dawn of time to have access to the rich mines of Turdetania. Legends talk about the fall of Tartessos two centuries ago at the end of the battle of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName] between a coalition of [GetCountry('ETR').GetAdjective]s and [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s and the Phocaean Greeks of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], but the truth is more complex than that.\n\nPhoenician influence had been constant in the region, and lead to a situation in which Canaanite gods were worshiped equally as often as the local gods, especially the goddess 'Ashtart and the god Melqart. The upper classes took a step forward and embraced Punic customs as their own. This situation created a rich melting pot that created a unique culture.\n\nInstability galvanizes the region in a time when the [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective]s are at the gates of Turdetania looking for her wealth. Only time will tell if the Turdetanians will survive."
