Yet with the growing power of Carthage, and the local tribes becoming better organized, Emporion's existence is strengthened by defensive agreements with the nearby Greek cities of Massilia and Hemeroskopeion, but there are question as to whether this will be enough to keep the city free."

 interesting_histories_country_events.vnt.desc:0 "The Italic Veneto people live between the Dolomite mountain range and the Adriatic Sea, a landscape made up of rivers, marshes and coastal islands. They are renowned for being excellent horse-breeders, producing some of the strongest and fastest horses in the Hellenic world. The city of Altinum is a flourishing trading center located along the Amber Road, a trade route where amber from the distant Baltic Sea is transported south to the Mediterranean. The Veneti have been in recurring conflict with Gallic tribes who have now settled on land previously inhabited by Italic nations. And from across the Pontus Adriaticum, a powerful Spartan prince eyes prosperous Venetic settlements as prospects for plunder. Veneto must move quickly to secure allies if it is to emerge successful and crush all future incursions."
