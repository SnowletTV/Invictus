They are involved in some sort of dispute with [GetCountry('SOG').GetName], and our spies report that the two nations are currently fighting each other to the death - may the gods see fit to destroy them both.\n\nOur spies were also hesitant to share the following story, but they did, albeit it under great duress; it is said that your wife, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSpouse.GetName], who is a childhood friend of the exiled ruler of Sogdia, was somehow involved in causing this calamity, but there is no proof of her involvement."

What madness compels those scraggly mountain dogs to invade our territory? A fly presumes to strike a lion.\n\nStrangely, when word of the Sogdian invasion reached the Seleukid diplomats that were living in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], they did not say anything to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but left in the middle of the night without warning.\n\nThere are rumors floating around that they were bribed somehow, but the truth of the matter is that the [GetCountry('SEL').GetName] will not be coming to our aid in this conflict."
