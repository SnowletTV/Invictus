 cyr_magas_01.1.t: "A New Governor for Cyrenaica"
 cyr_magas_01.1.desc: "Formally part of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greek colonies of Cyrenaica have been in disarray ever since the previous Ptolemaic governor was killed by his Syracusan allies during a failed invasion of Carthage in 444 AUC (309 BCE). As a new official governor hasn't been appointed yet, a group of local Greek elites currently remains in control of the country. \n\nFor now the gaze of our Egyptian overlords is locked firmly on their rivals in the east, but it is only a question of time until the Ptolemies will appoint a new governor for our region. And once they do they will likely demand closer integration with Egypt. \n\nMaybe we could ensure Egypt of our continued loyalty by approaching them to request a new governor before they make a decision on the matter. This might also allow us to maintain a greater degree of independence than other Egyptian holdings…  "
 cyr_magas_01.1.a: "Send the envoys."
 cyr_magas_01.2.t: "Magas of Kyrene"
 cyr_magas_01.2.desc: "A suitable candidate for the position of governor of Cyrenaica has finally been found: [GetCharacter('(int32)46').GetFullName], the stepson of [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetFullName] himself.  \n\nMagas's father Philip was an accomplished commander in Alexander's army, serving in the great conqueror's army from the first forays into Persian Anatolia to the invasion of the far-off lands of the Indus valley. \n\nMore importantly however, his mother [GetCharacter('(int32)18').GetFullName] recently married the Egyptian King [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetFullName], and her son [GetCharacter('(int32)45').GetFullName] - Magas's half-brother - though still young, is already considered a likely successor to the Egyptian throne. Berenike herself is the grand-nice of the former Macedonian regent [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetFullName] and a distant relative of Alexander the Great, making her a women of exceptionally high status even before her marriage to Ptolemaios.  \n\nBetween the military talents of his father and the heritage and political connections of his mother, Magas will allow Cyrenaica to play an important role in the wars over Alexander's legacy."

 cyr_magas_01.3.desc: " #R DEPRECATED. IF YOU'RE SEEING THIS SOMETHING WENT SERIOUSLY WRONG #! With our chosen governor on the throne, Cyrenaica enjoys considerably more local autonomy than Egypt's other subjects. However such a system is by its very nature fragile. If the alliance between Cyrenaica and Egypt is broken at any point, Egypt is likely to respond with an immediate declaration war."

From him and from his many companions Magas has inherited a keen interest in the lands of the far east. Now, emissaries from the greatest ruler in India [GetCountry('MRY').GetRuler.GetName] have arrived at our court. Alongside gifts and offers of trade, they bring with them knowledge of foreign medicines and word of a strange new faith."

Needless to say, he did not take the news well. Our emissaries have been executed and rumour has it that an army is being raised to "deal with the Cyrenaican rebellion" as we speak. "
 cyr_magas_01.9.a: "The fate of Cyrenaica is on the line…"

 cyr_magas_01.10.desc: "[GetCountry('EGY').GetAdjective] overlordship has long been a heavy burden on the shoulders of Cyrenaica. Now that the dynastic ties between [GetCountry('CYR').GetRuler.GetName] and the [GetCountry('EGY').GetRuler.GetFamily.GetName] rulers of Egypt have been broken the calls for independence are growing louder very day.\n\n On it's own however Cyrenaica stands little chance of victory. We should try to convince one of Egypt's many rivals to support our bid for independence."
 cyr_magas_01.10.a: "Send emissaries to every major power in the Hellenic world!"

 cyr_magas_01.11.desc: "Today [GetCountry('CYR').GetRuler.GetName] was crowned as King of Cyrenaica in a grand ceremony at the great temple in Cyrene. As jubilant crowds watched a golden head band was placed on his head by the high priest and dignitaries from every city in Cyrenaica were led before him to give gifts and swear oaths of fealty. \n\n Already new coins are being minted, stamped with the title [GetCountry('CYR').GetRuler.GetName], King of Cyrene and all the cities of the Pentapolis. Forgotten is the yoke of Persian and Egyptian rule. For the first time since the death of Arcesilaus IV in 313 AUC (440 BCE) a true king sits on the throne of Cyrenaica. "
 cyr_magas_01.11.a: "Long live the Kingdom of Cyrenaica!"
 cyr_magas_01.12.t: "The Death Persuader"
 cyr_magas_01.12.desc: "Influenced by the teachings of Buddhist missionaries, [death_persuader.GetName], a prominent philospher of the Cyrenaic School, has produced a particularly radical form of Cyrenaic philosophy. Like other Cyrenaic philosopher he believes that achieving happiness is the only purpose of life, and that anything that doesn't result in greater happiness is fundamentally meaningless. [death_persuader.GetName] goes further however by arguing that true happiness is unachievable in life, and that life itself is thus meaningless - even going so far as to claim that 'The sage man is indifferent between life and death.'. \n\n[death_persuader.GetName] has collected his teachings in a book called 'Death by Starvation'. Rumour has it that hundreds who have read the book have been convinced to take their own life rather than continue to suffer the pains of existence. From this derives the name under which [death_persuader.GetName] has become infamous: 'Peisithanatos', 'the Death-Persuader'. \n\n While some of these claims are certainly exaggerated, there is no doubt that 'Death by Starvation' is amongst the greatest works of philosophy of the current generation."
 cyr_magas_01.12.a: "It belongs in a library!"
 cyr_magas_01.13.t: "The Libyans"
 cyr_magas_01.13.desc: "The Libyans have inhabited [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName] since long before the arrival of the first Greek settlers. Traditionally, the Libyans have lived a nomadic lifestyle, herding goats, sheep and other animals. Since the arrival of the Cyrenaican Greeks many of the northern Libyans near the Greek cities have settled down, living in much the same fashion as their new neighbours. The Libyans of the south however have preserved their traditional nomadic lifestyle, moving along the caravan routes from oasis to oasis. \n\nWhen the first Greek settlers arrived in [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName], relations with the native Libyans were initially remarkably close. After the Greeks had originally settled at [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetName], it was a group of native Libyans who suggested the current location of [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] as a better place to found a city. The Greeks in turn chose the legendary Greek huntress $omen_cyre$ as the patron deity of their city (alongside $omen_apollo$ whose oracle had led them to Cyrenaica). Intermarriage between Libyans and Greeks was common, and many Libyan religious and cultural practices were incorporated into the Cyrenaican culture - first and foremost the worship of the Libyan ram-headed god $omen_ammon$. Nowhere is this mixing of culture more apparent than in Cyrenaica's second largest city, [GetProvince('(int32)3357').GetName], considered by many to be as much Libyan as it is Greek. \n\nHowever, since the early days of Greek settlement, Libyan-Greek relations have soured considerably. Nomadic Libyan tribes from the south  are a constant threat to the Cyrenaican cities, regularly aiding the countryside and occasionally banding together to attack the cities themselves. Relations with the northern Libyans, now a minority in their own lands, are still relatively good, but outside of [GetProvince('(int32)3357').GetName] intermarriage has become rare and Libyans often find themselves pushed to the fringes of society.\n\nNonetheless, the Libyans remain a powerful force within [GetProvince('(int32)3365').GetArea.GetName]. Depending on our actions, they might become a mighty ally or a powerful enemy for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s new government."
 cyr_magas_01.13.a: "We will seek reconciliation with the Libyans"
 cyr_magas_01.13.b: "The Libyan threat will be crushed" 
 cyr_magas_01.14.t: "Pre-emptive Strikes"
 cyr_magas_01.14.desc: "In order to combat the threat of Libyan raids against our countryside we have intensified patrols along the edge of the desert. A few particularly daring commanders have even launched  pre-emptive attacks against groups of Libyan nomads which they considered suspicious. This has helped drastically reduce the number of raids into our territory, but it has also caused a great deal of animosity amongst the Libyans along the border."
 cyr_magas_01.14.a: "Focus on guarding the border"
 cyr_magas_01.14.b: "Attack any Libyans we can find"
 cyr_magas_01.15.t: "The Libyan War"
 cyr_magas_01.15.desc: "It appears that the ongoing conflict with the Libyan natives has escalated into open war. \n\nFollowing a series of escalating raids and border skirmishes, the southern tribes of the Libyan desert have gathered around the charismatic leader of the Nasamones tribe. Now their combined host is bearing down on the cities of Cyrenaica, eager to take whatever loot they can carry and bring it back to their desert oases."
 cyr_magas_01.15.a: "They must be stopped before they can reach the weakthy cities on the coast!"

This is would be the perfect opportunity to advance our own ambitions, however it appears we still have some domestic issues of our own to deal with…"

 cyr_magas_01.16.c: "We can afford to bide our time."

 cyr_magas_01.17.desc: "[cyr_focus_martial_char_scope.GetOffice] [cyr_focus_martial_char_scope.GetName] is an exceptionally talented strategist.  Recently he appears to be eager to spend more time with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Although this might all just be a thinly veiled attempt to increase his own influence at court, it might help [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] deepen his understanding of the art of warfare…"
 cyr_magas_01.17.a: "We should spend more time with [cyr_focus_martial_char_scope.GetName]."
 cyr_magas_01.17.b: "Actually I had something specific I wanted to talk about…"
 cyr_magas_01.17.c: "This is a waste of time."
 cyr_magas_01.18.t: "Citizen Levy Exercising in Kyrene"
 cyr_magas_01.18.desc: "The backbone any Greek city's army is it's citizen levy, and [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] is no exception. It is part of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s duties as governor to ensure that the levy is in good order and ready to fight should the need arise. "
 cyr_magas_01.18.a: "The weekly levy drill will be lead by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] personally"
 cyr_magas_01.18.b: "Expand the training fields, the current exercise area is insufficient"
 cyr_magas_01.18.c: "That time would be better spent reviewing the ledgers"
 cyr_magas_01.19.t: "Pardoning the Exiles"
 cyr_magas_01.19.desc: "Scattered across the Mediterranean live a non-insubstantial number of Cyrenaican exiles. Most of them are people who were forced to flee their home cities following a disagreement about local city politics. However since many exiles still have relatives in Cyrenaica, petitioners begging [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] for a pardon are a common sight at the court in [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName]. \n\nBy and large the exiles are no threat to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s authority, but subverting the courts of Cyrenaica's cities by pardoning exiled criminals would not be popular with the citizenry. On the other hand, Cyrenaica is surrounded by many powerful rivals, and expelling its own citizens is a luxury it can ill afford."
 cyr_magas_01.19.a: "Mass pardon all but the most dangerous exiles, we need them here."
 cyr_magas_01.19.b: "This is not the time to anger our citizens by disrespecting their laws."

 cyr_magas_01.20.a: "Consolidate them into a band of warriors."
 cyr_magas_01.20.b: "Keep them at the ready in case we need reinforce the army."

 cyr_magas_01.21.t: "Alliance Through Marriage"
 cyr_magas_01.21.desc: "Securing Cyrenaica's independence on our own will be very difficult, considering the strength of the [GetCountry('EGY').GetAdjective] forces relative to our own. Fortunately, our overlords have many enemies who might be willing to support our cause. \n\nHowever, to ensure that our prospective ally won't abandon us when the time comes, we should insist on sealing the alliance with a royal marriage between [GetCountry('CYR').GetRuler.GetName] and a princess from our ally's court.  \n\nSeveral of the major Hellenic would make promising candidates for such an alliance."
 cyr_magas_01.21.a: "We will approach [cyr_marriage_country_scope_1.GetName]"
 cyr_magas_01.21.b: "[cyr_marriage_country_scope_2.GetName] would make a good ally."

The school itself was founded by #Y Aristippus the Elder#! during the time of Socrates, however many of his teaching were formalized only by [GetCharacter('(int32)233').GetName], called 'Metrodidaktos' ('Mother-Taught') since he learned philosophy from his mother (Arete, daughter of Aristippus the Elder). \n\nCyrenaicism is a hedonistic school of philosophy that emphasizes individual pleasure as the highest goal of human life. Other values such as a virtuous life are only valued to the extent and that they can increase the individual's pleasure or` decrease the individual suffering. \n\nRecently however, the popularity of Cyrenaicism has been in decline, largely due to the rise of new, non-Cyrenaic hedonistic philosophers such as [GetCharacter('(int32)218').GetName] whose ideas are more refined than those of Aristippus. In response a new generation of Cyrenaic philosophers has emerged who are trying to update the Cyrenaic school to allow it to compete with the other philosophical schools of the day. Of particular note are the teachings of [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName], [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName] and [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetName]. \n\nLike other Cyrenaics [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName] considers pleasure the ultimate goal of life, unlike Aristippus however he believes that pleasure needs to be consider for each action individually (rather than as the total pleasure accrued over ones lifetime), and that suffering is not the opposite of pleasure. Thus for [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetFirstName] virtues such as friendship, loyalty and patriotism can be good as they bring pleasure in the moment, even if they may occasionally cause pain and suffering in the long run. \n\n[GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName] too shares the common Cyrenaic belief in pleasure as the ultimate goal of life. However he openly rejects  friendship and patriotism as distractions from the pursuit of happiness, instead insisting that 'the world is his country'. In fact, [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName] believes that there is nothing inherently wrong with crimes such as theft and adultery - they are to be avoided only because the punishments society imposes in return cause suffering (and thus reduce pleasure). However [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName]'' most controversial claim by far is his insistence that the gods – or at least the commonly accepted gods of the Hellenistic world – are false and that gods, prayer, sacrifices and sacrilege are all just human inventions.

To this end, stoics strive to free themselves from passion, instead responding to everything in live with reason, logic and a calm mind. By following these teachings, the Stoics believe they can avoid suffering - and thus achieve happiness - by recognising the role that painful events play in the natural order of the universe. \n\nFinally, #Y Cynicism #! focuses on the pursuit of a virtuous live by rejecting the artificial conventions of society and living in accordance with the natural order. The Cynics preach poverty and shamelessness, not because they are below shame, but because they consider themselves above material wealth and shamefulness.

 #cyrene_1_magas_DESCRIPTION: "The lands of Cyrenaica form an oasis of lush plains and verdant forests amidst the unforgiving sands of the Libyan Dessert. \n\nIt was this wealth of resources which three hundred years ago, attracted Greek settlers from the island of Thera who founded the five cities of Cyrenaica: Cyrene, Taucheira, Euesperides, Belagrae and Barce. These five cities gave Cyrenaica it's two names, Pentapolis "The Five Cities" or Cyrenaica "The Lands of Cyrene" after the most important of the five. The commander of the group that founded Cyrene took the local Libyan name Battus, and his descendants would reign as Kings of Cyrenaica until the Kingdom's fall to the expanding Persian Empire. \n\nUnder the rule of the Battids the young colonies of Colonies of Cyrenaica grew to be one of the most important centres of learning in the Greek world, it's medical school and philosophical academy at times rivalling Athens itself. The flurishing trade with Crete and the Greek cities on the Peleponnese brought with it not only much wealth, but also a growing number of new settlers from all over the Greek world. \n\nSoon however, tensions between the original settlers from Thera, other Greeks, and the local Libyans began to grow. And thus, around the year 200 AUC (~550 BCE) the then king of Cyrenaica, Battus III, in an attempt to stabilise his realm instituted constitutional reforms which greatly limited the authority of the king in favour of an elected senate. Battus III's heirs greatly resented this move towards republicanism until, following a series of civil wars and the eventual murder of his father Arcesilaus III, the grandson of Battus III, Battus IV, invited in the armies of Persia in order to secure his old rights. \n\nSubmission to the Persians however would not save the Battid dynasty. In the year 313 AUC (440 BCE) Battus IV's successor, Arcesilaus IV would likewise be murdered by his own citizens, to be replaced this time not by another Battid ruler, but by a governor appointed by the Persian Emperor. \n\nThus the Kingdom of Cyrenaica came to an end, replaced first by Persian rule and then by submission to its conquerors, Alexander the Great and ultimately his successor in Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter. Ptolemy put Cyrenaica into the hands of Ophellas, a veteran of Alexander's Indian campaign. Ophellas however was killed when he was betrayed by his own allies during an invasion of Carthage. The death of Ophellas has left Cyrenaica without an official ruler, formally still part of Egypt but de facto independent.
