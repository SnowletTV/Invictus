It is different on the comets, where they think long-haired people beautiful - there were visitors in the moon who told us about them. Another point-they have beards that grow a little above the knee, and they have no toe-nails, but are all single-toed. Over each man's rump grows a long cabbage-leaf, like a tail, which is always green and does not break if he falls on his back. - A True Story"
 LOADING_TIP_138:0 "Mitylene is a large and beautiful city on the island of Lesbos. A strait whose waters flow gently from the sea separates it from the mainland. Many bridges of wood and brilliant white stone garnish its roads. You would not believe that you're looking at a city but an island. - Longus, from Daphnis et Chloe"
 LOADING_TIP_139:0 "Lamon first thought of carrying off the tokens and leaving the infant, but then shame came over him. 'Am I less than a goat in kindness toward a baby?' He waited until darkness, and, under its cover, he brought everything home to his wife Myrtale, the tokens, the child, the goat herself. Myrtale was confused: 'Do goats bear children?' she asked. - Longus, from Daphnis et Chloe"
 LOADING_TIP_140:0 "Dryas and Lamon were upset by what they had seen. Were the children to turn out to be goatherds and shepherds? For this, when their swaddling clothes promised so much better an outcome and fortune? Was it because of that fortune that they raised the children on fine foods and taught them their letters and many beautiful things from country life? - Longus, from Daphnis et Chloe"
 LOADING_TIP_141:0 "Already spring was ending, and summer was beginning. Everything was at its most glorious. The trees were laden with fruit, the plains were spread with standing crops, and the cicadas resounded pleasantly. The fruits smelled sweet, and the herds bleated with delight. You would suppose that even the gently flowing rivers were singing, and the winds, breathing upon the pines, were emitting the sounds of a pipe, and apples were longing to plunge to the earth, and the sun, that lover of beauty, was stripping clothes off everybody. - Longus, from Daphnis et Chloe"
 LOADING_TIP_142:0 "They decided to honor their benefactor. They joined Dorkon's relatives in burying the poor man. They heaped much earth upon him and planted many cultivated plants and hung up the first fruits of their efforts as a sacrifice. They poured offerings of milk and pressed clusters of grapes and broke many shepherd pipes over him. There were heard the piteous lowing of the cows, and some cows were seen scampering about in disorder. As it seemed among the flocks and herds, these actions served as the cows' lament at the death of their herdsman. - Longus, from Daphnis et Chloe"
 LOADING_TIP_143:0 "Beginning with thee, O Phoebus, I will recount the famous deeds of men of old, who, at the behest of King Pelias, down through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks, sped well-benched Argo in quest of the golden fleece. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_144:0 "Do not, I pray thee, mother, store up bitter sorrows overmuch, for thou wilt not redeem me from evil by tears, but wilt still add grief to grief. For unseen are the woes that the gods mete out to mortals; be strong to endure thy share of them though with grief in thy heart; take courage from the promises of Athena, and from the answers of the gods... - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_145:0 "Vain wretch, thou art devising destruction for thyself before the time. Does the pure wine cause thy bold heart to swell in thy breast to thy ruin, and has it set thee on to dishonor the gods? Other words of comfort there are with which a man might encourage his comrade; but thou hast spoken with utter recklessness. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_146:0 "Come now, tell me this by thy prophetic art, whether for me too the gods will bring to pass such doom as thy father promised for the sons of Aloeus. And bethink thee how thou wilt escape from my hands alive, if thou art caught making a prophecy vain as the idle wind. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_147:0 "Son of Aeson, be not wroth with me, if in my folly I have erred, for grief wrought upon me to utter a word arrogant and intolerable. But let me give my fault to the winds and let our hearts be joined as before. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_148:0 "Listen, ye wanderers by sea, to what it befits you to know. It is the rule that no stranger who comes to the Bebrycians should depart till he has raised his hands in battle against mine. Wherefore select your bravest warrior from the host and set him here on the spot to contend with me in boxing. But if ye pay no heed and trample my decrees under foot, assuredly to your sorrow will stern necessity come upon you. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_149:0 "But the hero, ever unwounded, by his skill baffled the rush of his foe, and he quickly noted the brutal play of his fists to see where he was invincible in strength, and where inferior, and stood unceasingly and returned blow for blow. And as when shipwrights with their hammers smite ships' timbers to meet the sharp clamps, fixing layer upon layer; and the blows resound one after another; so cheeks and jaws crashed on both sides, and a huge clattering of teeth arose, nor did they cease ever from striking their blows until labored gasping overcame both. And standing a little apart they wiped from their foreheads sweat in abundance, wearily panting for breath. Then back they rushed together again, as two bulls fight in furious rivalry for a grazing heifer. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_150:0 "But when the sun rising from far lands lighted up the dewy hills and wakened the shepherds, then they loosed their hawsers from the stem of the baytree and put on board all the spoil they had need to take; and with a favoring wind they steered through the eddying Bosporus. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_151:0 "Unhappy one, none other of men is more wretched than thou, methinks. Why upon thee is laid the burden of so many sorrows? Hast thou with baneful folly sinned against the gods through thy skill in prophecy? For this are they greatly wroth with thee? - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_152:0 "That folk have no care for ploughing with oxen or for any planting of honey-sweet fruit; nor yet do they pasture flocks in the dewy meadow. But they cleave the hard iron-bearing land and exchange their wages for daily sustenance; never does the morn rise for them without toil, but amid bleak sooty flames and smoke they endure heavy labor. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_153:0 "Ill-starred one, why art thou so smitten with despair? We know how ye went in quest of the golden fleece; we know each toil of yours, all the mighty deeds ye wrought in your wanderings over land and sea. We are the solitary ones, goddesses of the land, speaking with human voice, the heroines, Libya's warders and daughters. Up then; be not thus afflicted in thy misery, and rouse thy comrades. - The Argonautica"
 LOADING_TIP_154:0 "What makes the cornfield smile; beneath what star, Maecenas, it is meet to turn the sod or marry elm with vine; how tend the steer; what pains for cattle-keeping, or what proof of patient trial serves for thrifty bees - such are my themes. - The Georgics of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_155:0 "Mark too, what time the walnut in the woods with ample bloom shall clothe her, and bow down her odorous branches. If the fruit prevail, like store of grain will follow, and there shall come a mighty winnowing-time with mighty heat; but if the shade with wealth of leaves abound, vainly your threshing-floor will bruise the stalks rich but in chaff. - The Georgics of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_156:0 "First, nature's law for generating trees is manifold; for some of their own force spontaneous spring, no hand of man compelling, and possess the plains and river-windings far and wide, as pliant osier and the bending broom, poplar, and willows in wan companies with green leaf glimmering gray; and some there be from chance-dropped seed that rear them, as the tall chestnuts, and, mightiest of the branching wood, Jove's Aesculus, and oaks, oracular deemed by the Greeks of old. - The Georgics of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_157:0 "But if fierce squadrons and the ranks of war delight thee rather, or on wheels to glide at Pisa, with Alpheus fleeting by, and in the grove of Jupiter urge on the flying chariot, be your steed's first task to face the warrior's armed rage, and brook the trumpet, and long roar of rumbling wheels, and clink of chiming bridles in the stall; then more and more to love his master's voice caressing, or loud hand that claps his neck. - The Georgics of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_158:0 "Nay, every race on earth of men, and beasts, and ocean-folk, and flocks, and painted birds, rush to the raging fire: love sways them all. - The Georgics of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_159:0 "Assume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh, dear child of gods, great progeny of Jove! See how it totters- the world's orbed might, Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound; all, see, enraptured of the coming time! - The Eclogues of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_160:0 "Sooner shall light stags, therefore, feed in air, the seas their fish leave naked on the strand, Germans and Parthians shift their natural bounds, and these the Arar, those the Tigris drink, than from my heart his face and memory fade. - The Eclogues of Virgil"
 LOADING_TIP_161:0 "It becomes all men, who desire to excel other animals, to strive, to the utmost of their power, not to pass through life in obscurity, like the beasts of the field, which nature has formed groveling and subservient to appetite. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_162:0 "Yet it was long a subject of dispute among mankind, whether military efforts were more advanced by strength of body, or by force of intellect. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_163:0 "Both in peace and in war it is possible to obtain celebrity; many who have acted, and many who have recorded the actions of others, receive their tribute of praise. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_164:0 "I myself, however, when a young man, was at first led by inclination, like most others, to engage in political affairs; but in that pursuit many circumstances were unfavorable to me; for, instead of modesty, temperance and integrity, there prevailed shamelessness, corruption and rapacity. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_165:0 "Of the city of Rome, as I understand, the founders and earliest inhabitants were the Trojans, who, under the conduct of Aeneas, were wandering about as exile from their country, without any settled abode. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_166:0 "But among themselves the grand rivalry was for glory; each sought to be the first to wound an enemy, to scale a wall, and to be noticed while performing such an exploit. - Sallust"
 LOADING_TIP_167:0 "For fortified towns the following general principles are to be observed. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site will be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor cold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighborhood. - Vitruvius "
 LOADING_TIP_169:0 "Consequently, the method of construction employed by the Greeks is not to be despised. They do not use a structure of soft rubble polished on the outside, but whenever they forsake dimension stone, they lay courses of lava or of some hard stone, and, as though building with brick, they bind the upright joints by interchanging the direction of the stones as they lie in the courses. Thus they attain to a perfection that will endure to eternity. - Vitruvius"
 LOADING_TIP_170:0 "Since such very powerful kings have not disdained walls built of brick, although with their revenues and from booty they might often have had them not only of masonry or dimension stone but even of marble, I think that one ought not to reject buildings made of brick-work, provided that they are properly 'topped'. But I shall explain why this kind of structure should not be used by the Roman people within the city, not omitting the reasons and the grounds for them. - Vitruvius"
 LOADING_TIP_171:0 "The Greeks lay out their forums in the form of a square surrounded by very spacious double colonnades, adorn them with columns set rather closely together, and with entablatures of stone or marble, and construct walks above in the upper story. But in the cities of Italy the same method cannot be followed, for the reason that it is a custom handed down from our ancestors that gladiatorial shows should be given in the forum. - Vitruvius"
 LOADING_TIP_172:0 "Then the Rhodians, freed from the war by the cunning of Diognetus, thanked him publicly, and decorated him with all honors and distinctions. Diognetus brought that helepolis into the city, set it up in a public place, and put on it an inscription: "Diognetus out of the spoils of the enemy dedicated this gift to the people." Therefore, in works of defense, not merely machines, but, most of all, wise plans must be prepared. - Vitruvius"
 LOADING_TIP_173:0 "To prevent chafing: when you set out on a journey, keep a small branch of Pontic wormwood under the anus. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_174:0 "It is true that to obtain money by trade is sometimes more profitable, were it not so hazardous; and likewise money-lending, if it were as honorable. Our ancestors held this view and embodied it in their laws, which required that the thief be mulcted double and the usurer fourfold; how much less desirable a citizen they considered the usurer than the thief, one may judge from this. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_175:0 "Be a good neighbor, and do not let your people commit offences. If you are popular in the neighborhood it will be easier for you to sell your produce, easier to let out your work, easier to secure extra hands. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_176:0 "The following are the duties of the overseer:— He must show good management. The feast days must be observed. He must withhold his hands from another's goods and diligently preserve his own. He must settle disputes among the slaves; and if anyone commits an offence he must punish him properly in proportion to the fault. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_177:0 "Tunics, togas, blankets, smocks, and shoes should be bought at Rome; caps, iron tools, scythes, spades, mattocks, axes, harness, ornaments, and small chains at Cales and Minturnae; spades at Venafrum; carts and sledges at Suessa and in Lucania; jars and pots at Alba and at Rome; and tiles at Venafrum. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_178:0 "Oxen may be yoked on feast days for these purposes: to haul firewood, bean stalks, and grain for storing. There is no holiday for mules, horses, or donkeys, except the family festivals. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_179:0 "Of the medicinal value of the cabbage: it is the cabbage which surpasses all other vegetables. It may be eaten either cooked or raw; if you eat it raw, dip it into vinegar. It promotes digestion marvelously and is an excellent laxative, and the urine is wholesome for everything. - Marcus Cato"
 LOADING_TIP_180:0 "Give the cattle medicine every year when the grapes begin to change color, to keep them well. When you see a snake skin, pick it up and put it away, so that you will not have to hunt for one when you need it. Macerate this skin, spelt, salt, and thyme with wine, and give it to all the cattle to drink. See that the cattle always have good, clear water to drink in summer-time; it is important for their health. - Marcus Cato"
