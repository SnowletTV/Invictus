 ma_description:0 "The name Ma was used as early as the second half of the Third Millennium B.C. Although the oldest documented form of the name Ma belongs to Mesopotamia we can not reach definite conclusions on its origin. Her first appearance in Anatolia is also unknown. Ma's name means mother, but in addition to being a mother goddess, she was also considered to be a moon goddess and a warrior goddess. One of the most important temples of the Kingdom of Pontus was at Comana Pontica and was dedicated to the goddess of Ma. The cult of Ma was then carried onward to Comana Cappadocia. Eventually, Sulla, who claimed that in a dream that Ma gave him lightning to destroy his enemies, would introduce her cult to the eternal city."

 anahita_description:0 "One of the most powerful Yazatas, Anahita is venerated as the divinity of 'the Waters' and associated with healing, fertility and wisdom. She has been worshiped for a long time all over the Zoroastrian east, but the worship of the goddess Anahita was first introduced to Asia Minor in the 6th century BC by the old Persian Empire of the Achaemenids. Anahita's symbol is the lotus flower. At some point prior to the 4th century BC, this yazata was conflated with a variant of Istar, likewise a divinity of 'maiden' fertility and from whom Aredvi Sura Anahita then inherited additional features of a divinity of war and of the planet Venus."

 omen_anahit_desc:3 "$anahita_description$\n\nAnahit, the goddess of love, fertility, birth, and one of the most important gods of the Armenian people. Cognates of Anahit include Inanna, Astlik, and Anunit. Anahit is often identified with Artemis, and sometimes Aphrodite. She had many temples spread across Armenian lands, and may have been their most revered divinity. She was the wife of Armazd and sister to Mihr and Nane.\n\nWe hope the caring Anahit will bless our nation with protection for our young, her followers live comfortably with the knowledge that their children can now be brought to the world safely."

#Anaitis

 omen_anaitis:0 "Anaitis"
 omen_anaitis_desc:0 "$anahita_description$\n\nIn Western Anatolia, Anahita was often known as Anaitis, frequently syncretized with other goddess locally worshiped. Anaitis was regularly interpreted in Anatolia as Artemis rather than as Aphrodite, that is, as a fertility goddess, presumably because she was worshiped predominantly as a river divinity, hence as a source of productiveness. However, in Lydia, Anaitis was identified with Cybele whereas she was identified as Aphrodite-Anaitis by the Greeks. The temple state at Zela was dedicated to Anahita and probably established in the late Achaemenid period, c. 4th century BC."
