 dhe_achaean_league.4.desc:0 "When her traitorous husband, [GetCharacter('(int32)522').GetName], was assassinated, [GetCharacter('(int32)523').GetName] assumed command of his forces, with whom her kindness had made her extremely popular. When the Sicyonians, hoping for an easy conquest over a woman, attacked the garrison to attempt to establishing an independent government, she quelled the sedition and crucified thirty of the rebels. [GetCharacter('(int32)523').GetPraenomen] would rule in [GetProvince('(int32)8003').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)418').GetName] for six years until she surrendered the cities to Ptolemy. Thenceforth, [GetProvince('(int32)8003').GetName] would struggle to free itself from tyrants.\n\n[aratus_scope.GetName] of [GetProvince('(int32)8003').GetName], a renowned statesman and general, has brought his city into the Achaean League. Known for his cunning diplomacy and military acumen, [aratus_scope.GetPraenomen] has liberated [GetProvince('(int32)8003').GetName] from tyranny and is hailed as a champion of Greek freedom. With such a distinguished leader now among our ranks. Many in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] call for him to be make the #E Strategos#! of the #E Achaean League#!."

 dhe_achaean_league.6.desc:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)418').GetName] used to be one of the greatest of the city-states of Greece, standing at the border between Attica and the Peloponnese. When the other city-states banded into leagues and alliances to fight one another, Corinth stubbornly stuck to its independence. During the wars of the Diadochi, the ancient city-state was turned into little more than a glorified fortification for the Macedonian troops, becoming the most strategic defensive position in the region.\n\nOur struggle with [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetPraenomen]' descendants for control of Greece continues, but [aratus_scope.GetName] has at last cast out the Macedonian garrison from the city of [GetProvince('(int32)418').GetName] and our troops now march through its streets."
