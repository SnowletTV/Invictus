### MISSIONS
 01_siculia_missions:0 "Ducetius' Legacy"
 01_siculia_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "150 years ago, the great Ducetius united the various Siculian tribes under his banner, establishing prosperous new cities in his wake and conquering Hellenic colonies one-by-one. However, after his defeat at the battle of Nomae at the hands of the trecharous Syracusans, the pan-Siculian army was destroyed, the capital city of Palice was burned to the ground, and the federation he forged collapsed in on itself. With our people scattered and divided, the Greeks and the Carthaginians have been able to colonize the rest of the island, leaving us hanging on a thread in the remote interior. It will be difficult, but as the last of the Siculians, we are the sole claimants to Ducetius' proud legacy, and should we manage to push back the Syracusan and Carthaginian colonists, we can restore our lost kingdom and ensure our survival for many generations to come."
 01_siculia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must push out the Syracusan and Carthaginian invaders if we are to survive as a people."

 #01_siculia_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must push out the Syracusan invaders if we are to survive as a people."
 01_siculia_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when we have destroyed Syracuse, secured control over the whole island, and re-established our kingdom."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_1:0 "Prepare for War"
 01_siculia_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "We cannot hope to survive the imminent battle for our survival by belief and bravery alone; therefore, we must adapt advanced drilling tactics from our neighbors and ensure our men have access to the highest-quality weapons on the battlefield."
 01_siculia_missions_task_2:0 "Forge New Alliances"
 01_siculia_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Being greatly diminished in size, we cannot possibly hope to take up arms against our enemies alone; therefore, we need to secure alliances with our neighbors if we are to take on Syracuse and Carthage, even if only temporarily."
 01_siculia_missions_task_2_allies_tt:0 "Has #Y 2#! or more alliances."
 01_siculia_missions_task_3:0 "Strike Acragas"
 01_siculia_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Since its near-destruction by Carthage a century ago, the city of Acragas has not been the same reckonable foe it was during Ducetius' day, existing in a perpetual state of decay and decline; although not a pushover by any means, Acragas stands alone on the island, giving us the perfect opportunity to strike now and seize access to its valuable port before it is claimed by either the Syracusans or Carthaginians."
 01_siculia_missions_task_3_war_tt:0 "We will have the option to either get claims or #R declare war on Acragas#!."
 01_siculia_missions_task_5:0 "Betray Calactea and Tyndaria"
 01_siculia_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "Although nominally our allies, the cities of Calactea and Tyndaria have been drifting close to Syracuse's orbit over the years, and with Agathokles' growing ambitions, it is only a matter of time before they find themselves in his iron grip. If we can strike first, we can secure access to the northern coast and put a dent in Syracusan expansionism."
 01_siculia_missions_task_5_war_tt:0 "We will have the option to either get claims or #R declare war on Calactea and Tyndaria#!."
 01_siculia_missions_task_6:0 "Save Money for Mercenaries"
 01_siculia_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "Our men have now learned the advanced training methods of our neighbors and have access to high-quality weapons, however, our army is small and there are few fighting age men available for our levies. Fortunately, our island is abundant in experienced soldiers available for hire; by saving up a significant stockpile of gold, we will be able to field a force on-par with our enemies."
 
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_4:0 "Avenge the Battle of Nomae"
 01_siculia_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "Long ago, Syracuse was our ally, assisting Ducetius in his struggle for liberation. However, afraid and jealous of our power, they betrayed our trust and sided with Acragas, culminating in our destruction at the battle of Nomae. Now that our ancient enemy finds itself vulnerable and distracted, with our preparations complete, it is time to strike with our new-found allies before Syracuse can shore up its defenses."
 01_siculia_missions_task_4_war_tt:0 "We will have the option to either get claims or #R declare war on Syracuse#!."
 01_siculia_missions_task_7:0 "Liberate our Kin"
 01_siculia_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Long ago, the Phoenicians and Greeks conquered and subjugated the Elymians, close cousins to our people inhabiting the western portion of the island. Carthage currently finds itself focused abroad, maintaining only a skeleton force to protect its Sicilian holdings; should we strike quickly and decisively, we can secure the ports before Punic reinforcements can arrive and liberate our kin from foreign tyranny."
 01_siculia_missions_task_7_war_tt:0 "We will have the option to either get claims or #R declare war on Carthage#!."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_8:0 "Victory over Syracuse"
 01_siculia_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "At long last, we have ousted the Greek oppressors and cast them out to sea back from whence they came. With Ducetius avenged, we can now focus on picking up where he left off and shape our own destiny."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_10:0 "Raze Syrakousai to the Ground"
 01_siculia_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "150 years ago, the Syracusans crushed our armies, broke the spirit of our people, and burnt our city to the ground. Why shouldn't we do the same now that the tables have turned?"
 01_siculia_missions_task_10_tt:0 "#Y Siceliote#! is NOT an integrated culture."
 01_siculia_missions_task_10_effect_tt:0 "#Y Syracuse#! will be burned to the ground, yielding valuable loot, but will be reduced to rubble and some pops will perish."
 01_siculia_missions_task_11:0 "Spare the City"
 01_siculia_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "Although we have suffered greatly at the hands of the Syracusans, now that we reign over their city, we can show that we are the better men by showing mercy and not sacking it as they had done to our capital, ensuring the loyalty of the Greek colonists. It would be foolish, afterall, to lay waste to a strategic trading port."
 01_siculia_missions_task_12:0 "Rebuild Palice"
 01_siculia_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "Although its existence was short-lived, the founding of Palice was a glorious achievement for our people, and its remarkably quick growth showed the area's untapped potential. With the ruins of the city now secured firmly within our grasp, we can reclaim Ducetius' crowning accomplishment and build the city anew."
 01_siculia_missions_task_12_tt:0 "We will have the option to set #Y Palice#! as our new capital."
 01_siculia_missions_task_12_tt2:0 "6 pops will settle in #Y Palice#!."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_13:0 "Preserve Our Traditions"
 01_siculia_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "A strong proponent of Hellenic civilization, Ducetius adopted many aspects from their culture into our own. However, this respect and admiration was not reciprocated on the part of the Greeks, who have continued to colonize into our heartland and bring our people to the brink of extinction. Now that our independence is secured, we should embrace our local traditions and customs over those of foreigners."
 01_siculia_missions_task_14:0 "Follow Ducetius' Footsteps"
 01_siculia_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "A strong proponent of Hellenic civilization, Ducetius adopted many aspects from their culture into our own. Now that we rule over Syracuse and many other Greek colonies, we should continue his syncretic policy of Hellenization, ensuring the civilization of our realm and the longevity of our rule."
 01_siculia_missions_task_14_tt:0 "#Y Siceliote#! is an integrated culture."
 01_siculia_missions_task_15:0 "A Third Option"
 01_siculia_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "After the defeat of the foreign invaders, much of the debate in our country has revolved around either continuing to intertwine our people with the Hellenic world and learning from their technology, or remaining true to the old ways of our ancestors and ensuring the survival of our culture. Although we have been influenced a great deal by the Greeks to the east throughout our history, there's another civilization in the west which is equally powerful; that of Carthage. With our control over the Punic colonies in Sicania, we can synchronize our culture with theirs and learn the ways of the sea without needing to bow to the Greeks."
 01_siculia_missions_task_15_tt:0 "#Y Punic#! is an integrated culture."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_9:0 "Victory over Carthage"
 01_siculia_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "After many long years, our western kin have finally been liberated from their foreign Punic oppressors. With the western portion of the island solidified under our control, we have access to the strategic Tyrrhenian trade, ensuring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] with wealth for generations to come."
 
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_16:0 "Entice Punic Merchants from Abroad"
 01_siculia_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "The Carthaginians have been the masters of Western Mediterranean trade for centuries, whose knowledge and expertise would prove invaluable now that we own all of Sicily; by building up the ports and marketplaces in one of the island's old Phoenician colonies, we can encourage Punic merchants to settle and bring with them their trade secrets."
 01_siculia_missions_task_16_tt:0 "Between #Y 3#! and #Y 12 Punic#! pops will arrive in either [GetProvince('(int32)7842').GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)96').GetName], or [GetProvince('(int32)94').GetName], depening on which city has the ports and marketplaces. If more then one city has the required buildings, the pops will randomly choose which city to settle in."
 01_siculia_missions_task_15_tt:0 "Punic is an integrated culture."
 01_siculia_missions_task_17:0 "Ensure the Loyalty of Influential Families"
 01_siculia_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Although there are many benefits such a union will bring, tying ourselves to a culture many perceive to be foreign and alien will be quite a tough sell to our people; by ensuring unquestioned loyalty among the most powerful and influential figures, acceptance of our reforms shall trickle down from them to the rest of our society, or at the very least least stifle any notable opposition to them."
 01_siculia_missions_task_17_tt:0 "Punic is an integrated culture."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_18:0 "Adopt the Canaanite Religion"
 01_siculia_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Faith in our gods has served us well, however, in order to purge Hellenic influence from our lands once and for all, we need to abandon Hellenic teachings and anything they tainted, including our basic religious practices. Although drastic, such measures are necessary if we ever are to become a country in our own right, and after the painful transition period, we will be left with a clean slate and a boundless horizon."
 
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_19:0 "Remember our Matriarchal Customs"
 01_siculia_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Long before the coming of the Greeks, we were noted for our unique matriarchal traditions in which women held substantially more rights and influence then they do today. Now that we have cast off the Hellenic tyrants and usurpers, to expunge the rest of their influence, perhaps we should go back to the old ways and return to females the ancient privileges lost to them."
 01_siculia_missions_task_26:0 "Embrace the Siculian Language"
 01_siculia_missions_task_26_DESC:0 "Our ancient Siculian tongue has been with us for as long as we can remember, and it is still spoken by many in the interior. However, with so many settlers arriving from Greece over the centuries, our most populous and hospitable areas have long-begotten their heritage, while most learned men conduct their business in Greek instead of Siculian; if we do nothing to stem the tide, we will become a colony in all-but-name. By founding Siculian-language academies in our most populous areas and enforcing its use within government, we can push back the Hellenic tide and return to the cities the speech of our ancestors."
 
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_20:0 "Formally Embrace the Hellenic Pantheon"
 01_siculia_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "For hundreds of years we have been in contact with the Hellenic world, oftentimes at the heel of foreign conquerors. Although we are still Sicels, we cannot continue to deny the impact that the Greeks have had and still have on us; therefore, to move forward, we should formally proclaim the adoption of the Hellenic pantheon, as it has been the defacto religion for many years."
 01_siculia_missions_task_20_tt:0 "We have converted to #Y Hellenic#! using the #Y Convert From Italic to Hellenic#! decision."
 01_siculia_missions_task_27:0 "Repositories of Knowledge"
 01_siculia_missions_task_27_DESC:0 "The Hellenic world is rife with the teachings of philosophy, art, history, and learning, from the works of Plato to the Histories of Herodotus; by granting public funding for libraries across our major cities, we can establish [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as a bastion for Greek knowledge and scientific advancement." 
 01_siculia_missions_task_27_tt:0 "A skilled #Y Hellenic#! scholar will travel to our country."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_21:0 "Sicily United"
 01_siculia_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "After many years of anguish and struggle, we have finally cast off the foreign tyrants from our shores. With the whole island returned to native control, it is time we also restore the ancient name bestowed upon it by our ancestors, #Y Trinakie#!, and with it, we can proclaim a nation for all Sicels."
 01_siculia_missions_task_21_tt:0 "We have enacted the #Y Unite Sicily#! decision."
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_22:0 "Consolidate Power"
 01_siculia_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "With no more foreigners on our shores threatening our way of life, now is the time to focus our attention inward and ensure that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will never again be subjected to the whims of foreign tyrants. Ducetius was a strong leader who held our people together with his charisma, intellect, and sheer force of personality; By following Ducetius' lead, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can consolidate power away from the chiefs and ensure stability."
 01_siculia_missions_task_24:0 "Secure Powerful Offices"
 01_siculia_missions_task_24_DESC:0 "Perhaps the best way to secure [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s powerbase is to strategically place [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] loyal family members into influential positions throughout the government, for they stand the most to gain in a monarchy, therefore, will be the most likely to support the transition."
 01_siculia_missions_task_25:0 "Proclaim Monarchy"
 01_siculia_missions_task_25_DESC:0 "By placing loyal relatives into key positions in the government and through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] high popularity among the Sicel commoners, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has managed to amass power unseen since the time of Ducetius, and can now officially crown [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] as king over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Long live Rex [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!"
 
 01_siculia_missions_task_23:0 "No More Tyrants!"
 01_siculia_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "With no more foreigners on our shores threatening our way of life, now is the time to focus our attention inward and ensure that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will never again be subjected to the whims of foreign tyrants. Ducetius was a strong leader who held our people together, but after his defeat, the Siculia of old collapsed and for 150 years we hung on to life by a thread; by dividing power into an elected chamber instead a single ruler, akin to the Greek and Punic republics, we can ensure that our fate will not be bound to a single man."

 me_siculia_5_title:0 "Betray Calactea and Tyndaria"

If we can strike first, we can secure access to the northern coast and put a dent in Syracusan expansionism."

 me_siculia_12_desc:0 "With the reconstruction of Palice, Sicels all throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are overjoyed, and many from all over the country are traveling to take up residency. This poses an interesting dilemma; do we keep the capital at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], or to honor Ducetius' legacy, do we proclaim Palice as the center of our Sicel nation?"
 me_siculia_12.a:0 "Palice shall once again be the center of our civilization!"

 me_siculia_16_desc:0 "After building up port infrastructure and marketplaces in the area, a number of Punic merchants have expressed an interest in taking up residency in our country. However, many are undecided, and providing a strong financial incentive might be enough to sway them over..."
 me_siculia_16.a:0 "The port investments are enough of an incentive, they can take it or leave it."
 me_siculia_16.b:0 "A small handout should do."

 me_siculia_18.a:0 "For Tanit!"
 
 me_siculia_10_title:0 "The Sacking of Syracuse"
 me_siculia_10_desc:0 "Over the course of 5 days, ravenous [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldiers looted and pillaged the city of Syracuse, leaving no structure untouched in their wake. Survivors described scenes of barbarism reminiscent of the sacking of Troy, with scores of temples desecrated, warriors carrying off entire carts of gold, and the very earth hewn in salt to prevent anything from growing there again. Although we have ensured Syracuse will never rise again, shockwaves have reverberated throughout the entire Hellenic world, condemning this atrocity."
 me_siculia_10.a:0 "Syracuse will never threaten our people again."
 me_siculia_10.a_tt:0 "6 pops in the city will perish."
 me_siculia_13_title:0 "Preservation of Our Traditions"
 me_siculia_13_desc:0 "A strong proponent of Hellenic civilization, Ducetius adopted many aspects from their culture into our own. However, this respect and admiration was not reciprocated on the part of the Greeks, who have continued to colonize into our heartland and bring our people to the brink of extinction. By ensuring our high priest is well-versed in the ancient rites and rituals of our people, we will ensure they will be preserved for future generations."

However, with so many settlers arriving from Greece over the centuries, our most populous and hospitable areas have long-begotten their heritage, while most learned men conduct their business in Greek instead of Siculian; if we do nothing to stem the tide, we will become a colony in all-but-name. By founding Siculian-language academies in our most populous areas and enforcing its use within government, we can push back the Hellenic tide and return to the cities the speech of our ancestors."

 me_siculia_27_desc:0 "With the construction of public libraries throughout the nation, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become a beacon of Hellenism in the west, with the sound of great debates echoing throughout the streets, enticing many scholars to travel from mainland Greece. One scholar in particular has displayed an exceptionally sharp mind, and would make for a perfect researcher should we allow him to serve."

 me_siculia_23_desc:0 "With no more foreigners on our shores threatening our way of life, now is the time to focus our attention inward and ensure that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will never again be subjected to the whims of foreign tyrants. Ducetius was a strong leader who held our people together, but after his defeat, the Siculia of old collapsed and for 150 years we hung on to life by a thread; by dividing power into an elected chamber instead a single ruler, akin to the Greek and Punic republics, we can ensure that our fate will not be bound to a single man."

 me_siculia_22_desc:0 "With no more foreigners on our shores threatening our way of life, now is the time to focus our attention inward and ensure that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will never again be subjected to the whims of foreign tyrants. Ducetius was a strong leader who held our people together with his charisma, intellect, and sheer force of personality; By following Ducetius' lead, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can consolidate power away from the chiefs and ensure stability."

 me_siculia_24_desc:0 "Perhaps the best way to secure [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s powerbase is to strategically place [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] loyal family members into influential positions throughout the government, for they stand the most to gain in a monarchy, therefore, will be the most likely to support the transition."
 me_siculia_24.a:0 "With our pieces in place, now it is time to act."

 me_siculia_25_desc:0 "By placing loyal relatives into key positions in the government and through [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] high popularity among the Sicel commoners, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has managed to amass power unseen since the time of Ducetius, and can now officially crown [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] as king over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
