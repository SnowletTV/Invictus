The nine priestesses of the Gallizenae dwelt on that island, and if the crones were to be believed they could turn themselves into beasts and command the winds. You came here because you needed their help.\n\n'Then you go, crone', you bellow at the old woman. 'I have business with the Gallizenae, but I will honor the gods and go no further'. The old woman smiled broadly, with not a tooth to show for it, and held out her open palm expectantly. Her dim eyes rolled back and forth in a crazed manner, looking at everything except you.\n\nReluctantly you place a pouch of coins, clinking softly, in her hand.

'We need no men, and besides they may not go' she mutters as the fishermen reluctantly leave.\n\nYou find yourself on the little boat, and the feeble woman appears not so feeble any more.

Those who are desirous of the best things in life often have to pay premiums, and this matter with the Gaesati is no different than any others.\n\nWith these adages in mind, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has agreed to pay the four hundred coins required to hire an advisor from the Gaesati, the fierce Gallic mercenaries from the mountains. Although the price is dear, we have high expectations of our new guest, believing that the wisdom imparted to our troops will be well worth the cost."

Our people are ambitious and hearty, unafraid of any challenges, and we soon had all of the freemen we needed - we are fortunate beyond measure, to be blessed as we are. These settlers are gathering near the foothills of the [GetProvince('(int32)3617').GetArea.GetName], awaiting word of where they shall be sent."

This is a great honor, reserved only for the most elite in our society, but whether or not we proceed is entirely up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nAlthough it is unpleasant to discuss financial matters when our entire nation is grieving, there are substantial costs associated with wagon burials and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to sign off on the purchases."

Everything has been done to exacting standards, and the omens show that the gods are very pleased by our attention to the finer details.\n\nThere is a respectful silence as the last of the earth falls over the wagon, and one by one, everyone turns towards [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who offers a few words."
