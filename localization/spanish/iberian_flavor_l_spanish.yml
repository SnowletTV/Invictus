Political instability devastated the Turdetanians after the fall of Tartessos and war is constant.\n\nThe mastery of [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] in the use of metals gave it an advantage over its neighbours. The [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] army won many wars against [GetProvince('(int32)1371').GetName], the other great Turdetanian city of the region, culminating in the conquest of the rival city. Later the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)1369').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)1372').GetName] befell the same fate.\n\nThe conquests have drawn the attention of the other Turdetanians, who see [GetCountry('CRM').GetName] as a threat. [GetCountry('ASA').GetName], the Southern neighbour, seeks to be the hegemon of the region too and created a League to prevent both [GetCountry('CAR').GetAdjective] and [GetCountry('CRM').GetAdjective] expansion.
