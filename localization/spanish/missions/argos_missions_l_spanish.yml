As the weeks went on, you had quite forgotten about the entire matter, seeking mostly to quiet the nagging of your extended family, and were quite surprised one afternoon when your advisors tell you that not one, but three Antipatrid brides have been sent to Argos; Kassandros must really like you! They are waiting in a villa to meet you, so you splash some water on your face and head down to where they are staying - you will have the evening meal with them.\n\n You are immediately tongue-tied when you are finally in their presence, the irony of which is not lost upon you; how funny it is that such a great orator as yourself, used to giving rousing speeches before the Assemblies, are at a loss for words. Each woman is exceedingly beautiful and exceptionally intelligent, and the conversation lasts for hours before their chaperones excuse them for the evening. You are left alone on your couch, head spinning with wine and the excitement of your possibilities; this will be a difficult decision."

It seems that their Archon, an ambitious young fellow that you have already heard a great deal about, has humbly requested that we send a royal bride to him. He comes from a good family, you are told, and this gesture would certainly solidify your reputation in Argos. And while there are certainly a number of unmarried women in our family, do we want to send such a gift to the Argives? Are they truly worthy?"

You hear the wedding celebration was one for the ages, though, and your friend in Argos is certainly pleased with you."
me_argos_3_desc_2:0 "The embassy we sent to Argos returns with frustrating news, and now three women of your family stand before you, faces red from crying and demanding vengeance. It seems that, after all of this discussion about sending a bride to Argos, negotiations fell through at the last minute, and now you have three embarrassed women berating you. With everything going on at the moment, this is a distraction to be sure, but you are not happy - not happy at all. You send your kinfolk away with vague promises and remind yourself to deal with the Argives later."

me_argos_20_desc_2:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has seemed preoccupied the last few days, refusing to divulge what is on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mind. Despite this minor distraction, as irritable moods are a rare thing for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], life goes on, as usual, at the capital. The endless debates in the Gerousia continue, the streets are filled with merchants and tradesmen, and the common people go about their days. The less ambitious might even be satisfied by this state.\n\nYet heads would certainly turn if they knew the real reason that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] seems anxious; as we speak, secret emissaries have been sent to [target.GetName], hoping to build support for a change in government. Even now, our campaign of whispers continues..."
me_argos_20_desc_3:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that the support of [target.GetName] will be a requirement moving forward, as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cannot hope to stand on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] own two legs when the time for rebellion is at hand. Still, it is known that [target.GetFirstName] is a faithful sort, although [target.GetHerHis] loyalty could certainly be purchased. As with everything in life, there are no promises."

'He won't run off to the Gerousia to report what you are saying.' \n\n'What do you say then, [target.GetFirstName]? Your support will be vital for what is to come.'"

You must admit that you are surprised when [target.GetFirstName] shows up in person at your home one evening, face hidden underneath the folds of their long tunic. 'Forgive the unexpected visit,' [target.GetFirstName] whispers, drawing close to you, 'but I dare not trust anyone else to answer such a sensitive request. I wanted to tell you, in person, that you can count on us when the time comes.'"

'If you continue down this rebellious path, we shall make it known to the authorities that you are plotting - abandon your foolishness and remember your place.' Crumbling the parchment into a wad, you sneer and toss it to the ground. Remember [target.GetName] and add their family to the proscription list; when the time comes, you will not forget their cowardly lack of support."
