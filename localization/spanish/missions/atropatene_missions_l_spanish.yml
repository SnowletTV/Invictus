atropatene_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The reputation of the Median people is known everywhere; our soothsayers and dream-interpreters, the most knowledgeable in the world, are sought after in all of the capitals of the great Empires. Our magnificent ruler Atropates I Atropatid once ruled as a satrap to both the Persians and the Macedonians, but the death of Alexander and the Wars of the Diadochi have given our people a taste of freedom for the first time in many generations. While many hope to subjugate our realm like so many others have before, our people, guided by the Zoroastrian Faith that sustains us, will not quietly submit to foreign authority. No - we have other plans."
atropatene_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when the Medes have restored the borders of the famed Cyaraxes, our third king that led our forces to eternal glory."
