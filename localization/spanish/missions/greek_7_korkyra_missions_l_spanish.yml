greek_7_korkyra: "Korkyra, the Black Island"
greek_7_korkyra_DESCRIPTION: "Korkyra, the island that we live upon, has been home to many peoples before us; Illyrians, Phaecians and Greeks have all called themselves masters of the Black Island, a nickname derived from the richness of its soil and the dense forests that have spread throughout the isle's interior. For many years, our affairs have been entangled with those of the Epirotes, and yet there is some hope that we will soon be able to separate ourselves from the happenings on the mainland. "
greek_7_korkyra_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when Korkyra has built up her infrastructure and military capacities and has created secure borders for her countrymen."
greek_7_korkyra_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Korkyra will not submit to her enemies, but will surprise the world with her accomplishments."

greek_7_korkyra_task_1_DESC: "Although the lands available to us are small, that does not mean that we should not develop them to the best of our abilities. The better our infrastructure is, the more room we will have for our citizens. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_2_DESC: "Trusting in nothing besides our own strength, we must do everything that we can to ensure that we are protected from foreign invasion. Building up our navy should be a high priority. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_3: "A Home for Foreign Fighters"
greek_7_korkyra_task_3_DESC: "Because we cannot rely on our own soldiers alone to defend our island, we have made it known far and wide that mercenaries will find long-term employment with us. It will take time and money to spread the word, but we are sure that the investment shall be worth it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil9!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_4: "Sharpening the Scythe"
greek_7_korkyra_task_4_DESC: "As any competent architect will tell you, if you hope to build a grand edifice, you will need a solid foundation; any shortcuts taken at the preliminary stages is only inviting disaster down the road.

greek_7_korkyra_task_5_DESC: "Our island has long been a home where gods have frolicked; even our name is derived from legend, for Korkyra was a nymph that Poseidon kidnapped and brought to our shores. Because our people have always retained their fondness of the gods, they are asking that we build a holy shrine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_6_DESC: "Although there are many foreign interests in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)459').GetArea.GetName], we must control all of the land on our side of the mountains - to allow an enemy this close to our island home is asking for trouble. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_7: "Entering Epirus"
greek_7_korkyra_task_7_DESC: "Although our neighbors in [GetProvince('(int32)421').GetArea.GetName] are stronger than us, we should not allow them to bully us the way that they do. Because they have ignored our diplomats, then perhaps they will listen to our soldiers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil7!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_9: "Something We Can Work With"
greek_7_korkyra_task_9_DESC: "Perhaps our army is small when compared to others, but our troops are battle-hardened and used to fighting in the most difficult terrain you can imagine...when it comes to military matters, we can definitely work with what we have.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil5!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_10_DESC: "The rugged highlands and mountain valleys of Epirus are home to a ferocious breed of mastiff known as the Molossian, which are fierce dogs that are suitable for training in war. We are training these beasts to fight alongside our men and to act as guard dogs...woe betide the poor soul who finds himself face to face with the business end of one of these hellhounds! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil17!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_11_DESC: "If we are able to secure the province of [GetProvince('(int32)422').GetArea.GetName], particularly the foothills that lead up into the mountain passes, we will control the road into heartlands of Macedonia itself. This will be the best way to keep a watchful eye on our unruly neighbors.\n\nTell our soldiers it is time for them to train in the Pindus, for we aim to become the undisputed Masters of these mountains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil12!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_12: "Stopping the Spartans"
greek_7_korkyra_task_12_DESC: "Will we ever be spared from the ambitions of conniving generals? Now we receive word that [GetProvince('(int32)427').GetName] fancies herself our better and thinks we will fall to her armies, becoming a foreign port for a burgeoning overseas empire. We will establish our reputation on the battlefield by humbling the proud Lacedaemonians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil14!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_13: "A Wealth of Knowledge"
greek_7_korkyra_task_13_DESC: "Part of the terms we imposed upon [GetProvince('(int32)84').GetName] after our victory included access to the writings of their philosophers and wise men, for we have heard many stories of the fabled engineers that work within the city walls.\n\nAlthough it will take some time for them to arrive, we have received assurances that a cohort of learned men are coming to our capital to instruct our own scholars. They will also bring the war indemnities they owe us, so we eagerly await their arrival. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil13!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_14: "A Gift from a God"
greek_7_korkyra_task_14_DESC: "The most peculiar thing is being reported from our citizens in [GetProvince('(int32)470').GetName], who claim that a sea god has been visiting the shrine we built there in the mornings, tarrying a while and then departing with the tides. We should personally visit the area, which legend says is the site of a former Phaecian colony, and make an offering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil3!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_15: "A Strained Relationship"
greek_7_korkyra_task_15_DESC: "Everyone that knows our histories knows that we are a former colony of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)418').GetName]. Although we used to have a wonderful relationship with our erstwhile hometown, as of late, it has become strained beyond repair... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil8!"

greek_7_korkyra_task_16: "Grabbing the Heel"
greek_7_korkyra_task_16_DESC: "The rich port cities across the waters of the Fretum Hydruntis are calling out to us like the fabled sirens, singing a sweet song that promises wealth and glory if we expand our presence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
