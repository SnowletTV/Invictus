gymnaesian_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Balearides, the islands that our people call home, are far away from the disturbances and wars that devastate the Eastern Mediterranean; occasionally, we hear news of these conflagrations from passing traders, and thank the gods that these disasters have avoided our homeland thus far. Although our isles are viewed as a sleepy backwater, hardly worth noticing, that does not mean that we do not harbor ambitions of our own."
gymnaesian_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete once the inhabitants of the Balearides create a naval hegemony over the nearby islands."

# Mission Tasks
####################

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_01:0 "The Balearide Crown"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_01_DESC:0 "We, as a people, have come a very long way, and this change in our affairs would best be represented by a change in government. Instead of being ruled by magistrates, our people desire a King. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil10!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_02:0 "The First Step"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_02_DESC:0 "We have discovered a small island to the west of our capital, [GetProvince('(int32)1464').GetName], that seems to be a vassal of some larger nation. Perhaps while their overlord is occupied with war, we can quickly annex their land... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_03:0 "The Ibasim Conquest"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_03_DESC:0 "We have received reports that [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetArea.GetName] is now involved in a war - we must act quickly while their armies are occupied! We need every advantage that we can secure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_04:0 "The Navy of Gymnaesia"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_04_DESC:0 "Having seen the benefits of owning a powerful fleet of ships, we must also expand our navy if we hope to successfully land our troops on enemy land. Besides, there will be civic benefits from expanding our naval capacity, so all the more reason to get started. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_04_tt:0 "Have a navy of at least 12 ships"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_05:0 "La Ciudad de Palma"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_05_DESC:0 "While we are certainly proud of our capital [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], knowing that our ancestors chose wisely when erecting the first dwellings, we should consider upgrading our infrastructure. Thankfully, there are many architectural styles we are familiar with; let us replace our wooden structures with something more permanent. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_06:0 "Expedition to the East"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_06_DESC:0 "Prepare our settlers; we are sending them to [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetArea.GetName], hopefully to establish a new life for themselves and our people. How brave our people are, to leave the security of our home for distant shores! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil10!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_07:0 "A Pirate's Life"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_07_DESC:0 "There is no dishonor in taking things by force; might makes right, after all. Now that we have a large navy and a competent commander, we can begin to raid our neighbors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_07_tt:0 "Have a navy of at least 35 ships and a commander with a martial level of at least 10."
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_07_tt_a:0 "Slave Raiding ability will be enabled."

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_08:0 "La Ciudad de Ibasim"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_08_DESC:0 "After the conquest of [GetProvince('(int32)1464').GetName] from the Punic local power, we must build back up this island and improve the infrastructure to faster integrate our new population. We have a grand vision for the city of Ibasim... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_09:0 "Expansion in Corsica"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_09_DESC:0 "The entirety of the island of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetArea.GetName] to our east would be an incredible addition to our domain; it is much larger than our homeland, with plenty of natural resources that we are highly desirous of. There are even cities there, like [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetName], that one day we shall soon possess. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_10:0 "Embracing Piracy"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_10_DESC:0 "For a long time, the Pirates of [GetProvince('(int32)1469').GetName] have raided the Mare Sardoum with impunity - no one has been safe from these privateers, not even our own people. And yet...perhaps instead of expelling them from the isle, we could embrace them? These pirates are very knowledgable sorts, having plied their trade in the region for a very long time, and could definitely teach us a thing or two. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_11:0 "Island Paradise"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_11_DESC:0 "It is widely acknowledged that our homelands are among the most beautiful places one can hope to see; truly, we live on an island paradise. It would be beneficial for us to improve our holdings on the islands; if we but increase the amount of buildings, we are fully confident that our reputation will continue to grow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_12:0 "Consolidating Corsica"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_12_DESC:0 "Now that we have colonized all that we can on [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetArea.GetName], we should look into conquering the remaining territories of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetArea.GetName]. But these lands are hotly contested between strong powers, complicating our plans. No one said this would be a simple undertaking, but the omens speak favorably... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil11!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_13:0 "Puertos Fortificados"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_13_DESC:0 "Now that we have annexed these cities, it would be smart to fortify these ports so they can act as a good bulwark against our enemies, who grow jealous of our successes and hope to snatch our victories from us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_14:0 "Victoria en Cerdeña"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_14_DESC:0 "Now that we have exerted control over the island of [GetProvince('(int32)3515').GetArea.GetName] and finished mopping up resistance in [GetProvince('(int32)3483').GetArea.GetName], we cast our hungry eyes like a fisherman does his nets, scouring the seas and searching for our next conquests. Only the gods know where we shall sail to next! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil18!"

gymnaesian_mission_01_task_15:0 "Excedente de Madera"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_15_DESC:0 "We are able to project our power abroad because of our fleets, which makes having a supply of wood one of our most crucial needs. Our future demands that we import enough wood to ensure a steady supply for our navy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"
gymnaesian_mission_01_task_15_tt:0 "The Province of Balearides needs to be importing at least 1 wood and 1 cedar."

# Events
####################


me_gymnaesian_1_title:0 "The Balearide Crown"
me_gymnaesian_1_desc:0 "The day is finally upon us, one that seemed so faraway and distant that it could have been mistaken for a dream; the ascension our monarch, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], as the new ruler of the glorious Kingdom of Balearides. After countless years of being a federated tribe, it has been decided to reward [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who is most responsible for our current state of affairs, with the crown. No more shall we be ruled by councils of magistrates and elders, but we shall finally have a true sovereign to guide us.\n\nNo expense was spared for the coronation ceremony, as the finest wines and luxury foods were imported from abroad, supplementing the traditional dishes of our people. Borne on a litter of silver and ivory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was paraded through the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], showering gifts of golden coins upon the gathered crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal procession. The feasting and celebration will last well into the evening, perhaps even until the early hours of the morning. A day to be remembered forevermore by our countrymen!"
me_gymnaesian_1.a:0 "Long live [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!"

me_gymnaesian_2_title:0 "The First Steps"
me_gymnaesian_2_desc:0 "We have discovered a small vassal island to the west of our capital; we have no idea how long they have been thralls, but this is of no importance to us. But we are certainly closer to them than their overlords, giving us an advantage; if we strike during a strategic time, we can quickly annex them before their Master notices."
me_gymnaesian_2.a:0 "Summon the Tribal Leaders"

me_gymnaesian_3_title:0 "The Initial Conquest"
me_gymnaesian_3_desc:0 "After solemn deliberations, in which many a heated argument was raised, the tribal leaders have come to a decision and there shall be no going back. While the Elders were equally divided in their opinions, it was [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that cast the deciding vote, arguing eloquently on behalf of what must be done. It is fear that guides our hands, for we see how our neighbors are the slaves of a distant power, and we have no desire to become thralls of some foreign lord. To protect our future, we must cast out these enemies, lest we become the next to fall. \n\nThe element of surprise shall be our greatest ally. We shall strike our island neighbors once their overlord is embroiled in a war."
me_gymnaesian_3.a:0 "We must prepare!"

me_gymnaesian_4_title:0 "The Time is Approaching"
me_gymnaesian_4_desc:0 "It seems that the Carthaginians have become involved in a war. If we can strike now while they are occupied, we can hopefully annex their vassal before they notice. Although we are anxious about making such a bold move, especially when we consider the potential implications of angering Carthage, this might be our only opportunity."
me_gymnaesian_4.a:0 "We strike in a month"

me_gymnaesian_5_title:0 "The Ibasim Conquest"
me_gymnaesian_5_desc:0 "After weeks of nervous preparation, all is in place. We have prepared our tribal levies, who have been practicing their battle formations daily, and we have readied our navy to the best of our ability. Even now, our ships are being filled with provisions like foodstuffs, and it is only a matter of time before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] sends the order that the fleet should embark.\n\nPrepare yourself, for the time to strike is now. We shall not send word in advance to [GetProvince('(int32)3256').GetOwner.GetName], who will be too distracted to come to their aid...soon enough, everyone will know what we have done."
me_gymnaesian_5.a:0 "To war."

me_gymnaesian_6_title:0 "The Navy of Gymnaesia"
me_gymnaesian_6_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received a report from our naval commanders, one that you will find quite pleasing. It appears that, because we have spent the time and money required to upgrade our fleets, our engineers have mastered some construction techniques that we can apply throughout our realm. This is truly our lucky day!"
me_gymnaesian_6.a:0 "We will not complain about this turn of events"

me_gymnaesian_7_title:0 "La Ciudad de Palma"
me_gymnaesian_7_desc:0 "The rolling hills of [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName] were once home to scattered hovels and huts, but the lean-tos and shacks of yesteryear that sheltered our forebears from the elements are now a fading memory, a relic from a time where our powers were still growing. Guided by the civic visions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who demanded that cost be no consideration to the fulfillment of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] plans, the settlement of Palma has been replaced by a magnificent city. It won't be long before the glory of our newly-upgraded capital is known far and wide."
me_gymnaesian_7.a:0 "Palma is the perfect location for a city; well done."

me_gymnaesian_8_title:0 "Expedition To The East"
me_gymnaesian_8_desc:0 "The time has come to prepare our settlers for a journey to the East, to the island of Corsica. Our scouts report that there are other occupied territories present on the island, and although the eastern shores of the isle are unclaimed, we must be careful not to overstep. It doesn't take a military genius to foresee that we might have to fight to protect our colonists, but we will always protect our own."
me_gymnaesian_8.a:0 "Send them with our blessing"

me_gymnaesian_9_title:0 "Our colony is self sustaining!"
me_gymnaesian_9_desc:0 "It seems that our colonization efforts have been successful, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Thanks to your brilliant leadership, we now have a self-sustaining settlement, and many of our people are hoping to sail to this new land to start a new life for themselves. It won't be long before these islands have as many inhabitants as our homeland does."
me_gymnaesian_9.a:0 "Was there any doubt that we would triumph?"

me_gymnaesian_10_title:0 "Naval Raiding"
me_gymnaesian_10_desc:0 "It is truly a black day for our neighbors, for we have received news that our navy is large enough to begin raiding nearby ports. Before long, all shall fear us, hoping to never wake up to the sight of our raiding ships sailing over the horizon! Tell the men they can take anything and everything they can carry!"
me_gymnaesian_10.a:0 "Raise the pirate's flag..."
me_gymnaesian_10_tt:0 "Slave Raiding ability will be enabled."

me_gymnaesian_11_title:0 "Ibasim"
me_gymnaesian_11_desc:0 "While there have been considerable costs required to build up [GetProvince('(int32)1464').GetName], we have finally been informed that the construction initiatives have drawn to a close. Thankful beyond measure for what we have accomplished, the locals are eagerly embracing our ways, with hopes to become full-fledged participants in our culture. There is much to celebrate this morning, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
me_gymnaesian_11.a:0 "The gods take care of their own"

me_gymnaesian_12_title:0 "Expansión Corsa"
me_gymnaesian_12_desc:0 "You will be pleased, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], to hear that our expedition to Corsica is flourishing. Even now, our farmers are working the land, slowly but surely turning the wild fields fruitful, and the tax receipts they are sending home are quite nice. We have no doubt that, in a few years, no one will be able to distinguish between our new colonies and our established cities."
me_gymnaesian_12.a:0 "This is excellent, but we desire the entirety of Corsica..."

me_gymnaesian_13_title:0 "Blackguards and Brigands"
me_gymnaesian_13_desc:0 "We have recently concluded our negotiations with the pirates that live on the island of [GetProvince('(int32)1469').GetName]. It did not take long to convince them of the wisdom of what we were proposing, as the pirates seemed all too eager to accept our diplomatic overtures - good. They undoubtedly realized that working with us is in their best interests, as we have much to learn from each other."
me_gymnaesian_13.a:0 "It's a pirate's life for me..."

me_gymnaesian_14_title:0 "An Island Paradise"
me_gymnaesian_14_desc:0 "Some people live in mountain caves, battered about by the cruel whims of Nature's fury, and yet others make their homes in the desert, desperate for a few drops of water. Our people live in paradise, however; gentle breezes, warm waters and an abundance of food are our constant companions. We import the finest goods from around the world, and travelers from far and wide come to our ports to marvel at what we have wrought."
me_gymnaesian_14.a:0 "There is no place we would rather be than home"

me_gymnaesian_15_title:0 "Puertos Fortificados"
me_gymnaesian_15_desc:0 "Our navies are the source of our strength; to take away our fleets would be to take away our power. Realizing that the linchpin of our success is predicated upon having sufficient naval power, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] decreed that the coffers be opened and the infrastructure of our ports be overhauled. We have no desire to be taken unawares by our enemies, and securing our waterways will ensure that this calamity never comes to pass. Our strengthened ports shall become the foundation for our future glory!"
me_gymnaesian_15.a:0 "Woe betide the enemy that dreams of taking our harbors"

me_gymnaesian_16_title:0 "Victories in Sardinia"
me_gymnaesian_16_desc:0 "When we first set out to subdue the island of Sardinia, we were well aware of the possibilities that awaited us, with the expansion of our borders and new opportunities for trade being our prime motivators. Yet who could have foreseen the wealth that we would gather? Trade has simply exploded in [GetProvince('(int32)1465').GetName], as more and more taxes and tributes return to our capital. The wealth of Sardinia outweighs our greediest expectations...perhaps there are other islands we could take."
me_gymnaesian_16.a:0 "Exactly as we have planned!"

me_gymnaesian_17_title:0 "An Abundance of Wood"
me_gymnaesian_17_desc:0 "Considering the relative of importance of our fleets, it is unfortunate that we have a paucity of lumber; our islands simply cannot grow enough trees to supply our busy boatwrights. Thankfully, we have secured a steady stream of wood and cedar from those who are blessed with a surplus - may these economic bonds grow into a greater friendship."
me_gymnaesian_17.a:0 "We are pleased to know that we have friends abroad"
