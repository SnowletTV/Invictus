me_numidian_1_title:0 "The Numidian Crown"
me_numidian_1_desc:0 "The crowning our new monarch, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], as the new king of the glorious Kingdom of Numidia was such a spectacle to witness - truly, nothing like it has been seen in these lands. We have received envoys from tribes located all over the neighboring regions, their pack animals laden with tribute and gifts for the new King. Under the leadership of, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], our kingdom can only imagine what the future holds in store..."
me_numidian_1.a:0 "Long live King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!"

me_numidian_2_title:0 "The Initial Expansion"
me_numidian_2_desc:0 "It is known that we are hungry for new lands, eager to demonstrate by our might what we are truly capable of. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] shall deliberate with his advisors, having long discussions with every one of them, and then make a decision as to which frontier we shall expand."
me_numidian_2.a:0 "Summon the War Council"

me_numidian_3_title:0 "The Initial Conquest"
me_numidian_3_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has come to a decision, one that was easy to make in hindsight. We shall press our claim on the tribes located to the south, putting an end to their encroachments on our territories. The omens are favorable; we do not expect serious resistance to our designs."
me_numidian_3.a:0 "To War!"

me_numidian_4_title:0 "A Tribal Union"
me_numidian_4_desc:0 "Now that the tribe of [GetCountry('MSY').GetName] is under our protection as a client state, let us join together to strengthen our nation. We will begin the integration of [GetCountry('MSY').GetName] immediately. It will take a couple years of hard work, however upon completion, they will become an integral part of the nation."
me_numidian_4.a:0 "Begin the integration!"

me_numidian_5_title:0 "An Unlikely Alliance"
me_numidian_5_desc:0 "One thing has led to another; the unlikely friendship between the two rulers of [GetCountry('MSS').GetName] and [GetCountry('CAR').GetName] has forged the way for a strategic alliance between the two peoples. Now that we are friendly and have great relations with the powerful Punic nation of Carthage, they have allowed us to take leadership over the client state of [GetCountry('MSY').GetName], a relatively powerful Numidian tribe."
me_numidian_5.a:0 "Once step closer to a united Numidia!"

me_numidian_6_title:0 "Integration of Massylia"
me_numidian_6_desc:0 "Years of continuously working to integrate the nation of Massylia have finally paid off. We can now consider them to be an integral part of our kingdom.

me_numidian_7_title:0 "The Rival Tribe"
me_numidian_7_desc:0 "For far too long, the neighboring Numidian tribe has been a thorn in our side, whether it be raiding or impacting our trade. Omens have been taken, and it is understood that the gods favor our initiative to put an end to their continuous crimes. The time to strike nears; we must press our claim to be the dominant Numidian tribe and quickly annex their land before they secure stronger alliances and strengthen their soldiers."
me_numidian_7.a:0 "The time to strike is NOW!"
me_numidian.7.tt_a:0 "We will get claims on every province owned by [GetCountry('MAU').GetName]"
me_numidian.7.tt_b:0 "We will get claims on every province owned by [GetCountry('MSS').GetName]"

me_numidian_8_title:0 "The Discovery of More Minor Tribes"
me_numidian_8_desc:0 "As a result of our successful conquests, it seems that we have encountered a variety of other tribes with strange ways that are unfamiliar to our own. Given these vast differences, it is becoming apparent that it will be difficult for us to live harmoniously side-by-side; perhaps we can expand our borders a littler further..."
me_numidian_8.a:0 "Let us continue to push further"

me_numidian_9_title:0 "Rebuilding our Newly Conquered Land"
me_numidian_9_desc:0 "As a result of rebuilding our newly conquered land and improving the existing infrastructure, we have earned the goodwill of the population who occupies the land. People erroneously think we are simple horsemen, barbarians unfamiliar with how to manage a territory; what you have accomplished here shall put an end to these misconceptions."

me_numidian_10_title:0 "The Client State of Socosia"
me_numidian_10_desc:0 "You have finished meeting with your advisors, and some important decisions have been made. The client state of Socosia shall help us in our future military endeavors.

me_numidian_11_title:0 "Numidian Commanders"
me_numidian_11_desc:0 "Now that we have found an excellent commander to lead our army, we can continue to push forward with our conquests. With true Numidian Commanders at the head of our light cavalry, we shall smash any foolish enough to stand before our trampling hooves!"
me_numidian_11.a:0 "We have chosen our new Commander wisely!"

me_numidian_12_title:0 "Equestrianism"
me_numidian_12_desc:0 "We now have a reliable, steady production of horses within our nation, thanks to the commands that you have given and that we have faithfully enacted. We can use this surplus to build up our army, increasing the size and quality of our horsemen, and increase our population's output. You were very wise to suggest this course of action; these horses will prove vital in our future conquests."
me_numidian_12.a:0 "We shall strengthen our army"

me_numidian_13_title:0 "Confronting Carthage"
me_numidian_13_desc:0 "Carthage and their many subjects currently hold some land that we consider territories of vital interest. We must take back the land that once belonged to our ancestors, may they guide our avenging hands, and strike before our foes have time to prepare."
me_numidian_13.a:0 "The time to strike Carthage is now"

me_numidian_14_title:0 "An Alliance Network"
me_numidian_14_desc:0 "Creating this alliance network with some of the Iberian tribes might prove useful in deterring potential invaders from our nation. If only we could convince our new allies to help us in our offensive wars! There wouldn't be many who could stand against the combined onslaught."
me_numidian_14.a:0 "To long and prosperous alliances"

me_numidian_15_title:0 "The Straits"
me_numidian_15_desc:0 "Now that we control the two territories on either side of the straits, we essentially control all trade coming in and out of the Mediterranean. Yet with this success comes new responsibilities; we will need a navy to help protect our trade interests from potential pirates."
me_numidian_15.a:0 "Our nation shall prosper"

me_numidian_16_title:0 "Numidia is Ours!"
me_numidian_16_desc:0 "Our confrontation with [GetCountry('CAR').GetName] and their various subjects was very successful. We were able to wrestle control from the region of Numidia from their grip and we now own almost all of the land that is rightfully ours. We now set our eyes past the newly expanded borders of our nation, on the region of Fezzan, and the islands of Sardinia and Corsica."
me_numidian_16.a:0 "One step closer to the Numidian Kingdom"

me_numidian_17_title:0 "The Fallen Fezzani Tribes"
me_numidian_17_desc:0 "The Fezzani tribes have finally fallen! Their levies were no match for our coordinated and disciplined armies, and we were able to quickly annex the desert land that they occupied. You would have laughed to see how quickly their armies scattered before our men - it was almost a waste of our time chasing them down."
me_numidian_17.a:0 "Our empire stretches yet further"

me_numidian_18_title:0 "The Region of Atlas"
me_numidian_18_desc:0 "Now that we have fortified the borders of our nation, we can set our eyes upon the minor Numidian tribes located to the south within the region of Atlas. It shall be a minor thing to hunt these brigands down, knowing that we can rest secure within our own strengthened territories."
me_numidian_18.a:0 "Their land will belong to us"

me_numidian_19_title:0 "The Numidian Empire"
me_numidian_19_desc:0 "We have conquered all of the land that belonged to our ancestors, showing to the world that our cause was just and sanctioned by the gods. We have fought many, many wars with local, regional, and major powers and we have always emerged victorious, despite the bloody and brutal costs we have paid in men and horses. We have shown resilience, determination, and patience in our conquests when others doubted that we could succeed. We should be proud of everything that we have accomplished - all hail the Numidian Empire!"
me_numidian_19.a:0 "We are unstoppable"

me_numidian_20_title:0 "Sardinian and Corsican Aspirations"
me_numidian_20_desc:0 "Now that we own the entirety of the African Region, the islands of Sardinia and Corsica to the north hold land that would prove useful, especially if we were to decide to start a campaign on the Italian peninsula. If you but say the word, we shall begin the initial preparations for what is to come."
me_numidian_20.a:0 "Sardinia and Corsica will be ours!"
