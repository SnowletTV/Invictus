 nuragic_mission_01_inv:0 "Reclaiming the Nuragic Homeland"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_DESCRIPTION:0 "For as long as the sun has traversed its path in the celestial realms, our people have lived simple and uneventful lives, our fortunes ebbing and flowing like the ocean waters that surround us. While some sneer at our ways and call us barbarians, we were content with what we had to call our own.\n\nThis has changed with the arrival of the Carthaginians, who have seized the southern coast of our island for themselves. Their diplomats have made it abundantly clear that our mountainous homelands are not safe from their encroaching armies, but we have a different idea about our future."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete when we have pushed the foreigners from our island and reclaimed it for ourselves."
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We must expel the invaders from our homeland, reclaiming it for ourselves."

 # Mission Tasks
 ####################


 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task:0 "Gathering the Tribal Elders"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_1_task_DESC:0 "Before we make any moves against the foreigners, we must first gather a consensus amongst our tribal brethren. We cannot do this alone; we will need to unite our strength if we have any hope of succeeding. Send word to the neighboring tribes that a Council will be held! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil3!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task:0 "Securing the Reserves"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_2_task_DESC:0 "If we have any hopes of winning in the field, our soldiers must be well-fed and ready to fight at any time, for hunger is an ever-present enemy that is difficult to escape. As soon as we have the funds available to us, we should build a farming settlement, as well as import as much grain as we can store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil14!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task:0 "Restore the Nuraghe"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_3_task_DESC:0 "In times of trouble, our ancestors retreated to the tower fortifications they erected, the nuraghe, waiting for opportune times to strike at their foes from these positions of strength. Before we wage our own wars, we must honor the ancient ways and make sure the nuraghe are fortified, as well as properly stocked with provisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil8!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task:0 "The First City to Fall"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_4_task_DESC:0 "There is a city in the north that the Carthaginians have named [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] that is relatively isolated...this shall be the first to fall to our armies. Having no cities of our own, we hope to use [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName] as a base of operations moving forward, so it is of vital importance that we eventually develop the infrastructure there. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic4!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task:0 "Locking the Back Door"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_5_task_DESC:0 "The ease of the crossing at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is known to everyone; it is a trivial thing for an army from Corsica to sail across the waters, and because we are loathe to allow anyone such easy access to our island, we must take measures to prevent this from ever happening. But first, we must expel the Corsians who are currently on our island first... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task:0 "A Foothold in Phikaria"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_6_task_DESC:0 "Dreams of foreign conquest are the last thing that we wish to entangle ourselves with, but all can see the prudence of securing the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3508').GetName] for our own purposes. Besides, we have no desire to see the Corsians prosper, especially at our expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil6!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task:0 "Eyes On the Hills"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_7_task_DESC:0 "One clear advantage that we have over the foreigners is that we know these lands well, whereas they are mere trespassers. We can use our knowledge of the terrain to our advantage, sending our men through difficult country to keep an eye on their troop movements.\n\nThe brigands that live in the mountains are expert trackers; we should send word of an amnesty, if they are willing to help us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil7!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task:0 "Sacrifice to the Gods of War"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_8_task_DESC:0 "There are arcane ways known to our shamans wherein our victories over our enemies are all but assured...the price asked by the gods of death is steep, however; they are only satisfied with blood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task:0 "The Port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_9_task_DESC:0 "Although the land itself is relatively undeveloped thus far, the Carthaginians consider the port of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] to be vital to their resupplying efforts, and because of this, we cannot allow them to control this location any longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task:0 "The Destruction of [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName]"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_10_task_DESC:0 "Like animals in a blood frenzy, our soldiers, bolstered by their recent successes in the field, can sense the doom of the invaders and demand that we press onward to [GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName], undoubtedly desirous of the rich treasures that are purported to be held within its walls. Our men will settle for nothing less than the complete destruction of the city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil15!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task:0 "Karalian Farmlands"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_11_task_DESC:0 "Truly, we have seen few places like [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]; a city surrounded by fertile vineyards, kissed by the sun and where true happiness surely lives. All who pass by this city desire an end to their travels, longing to stay on our estates and watch the dolphins play in waters of the Mare Tyrrhenum. We shall cultivate Karali, building it into a magnificent city regardless of the cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil16!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task:0 "A Southern Capital"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_12_task_DESC:0 "Having become the undisputed masters of our island, with our authority being acknowledged from the northern redoubts to the southernmost cities - indeed, the entirety of Sardinia is ours - it is safe to say that a new era has dawned, one where the Nuragic people will have a homeland of their own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil19!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task:0 "Seize the Ships"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_13_task_DESC:0 "Now that we have managed to secure a port city for ourselves, we should consider constructing a fleet immediately. Luckily for us, in their haste to vacate the region, the enemy abandoned a few ships that are in decent condition; it wouldn't take much to get them back in working order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil21!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task:0 "A Blind Eye to Piracy"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_14_task_DESC:0 "Although it has been many years since we have been in contact with our cousins, we have heard of the dread Pirates of Mago...perhaps they would like to come visit us for a while? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil24!"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task:0 "Stale Guests"
 nuragic_mission_01_inv_16_task_DESC:0 "Although it seemed like a good idea at first, the Talaiotic Pirates that we invited to take up residence in [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] have been running roughshod over the local inhabitants, a situation that is untenable over the long term. We need to take drastic action before it is too late. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil18!"

 me_nuragic_1_title:0 "A Council of Great Importance"
 me_nuragic_1_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] bursts out of the tent, a filthy stream of curses erupting from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mouth, and moments later is joined by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] entire entourage. All that are standing outside - not an insignificant number, as a large number of soldiers have been milling about all morning - can thus see for themselves how the negotiations are going. A quiet murmuring ripples through the gathering crowd as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] turns to address them, face flushed with rage.\n\n'A few weeks ago, I, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], sent word to the Tribal Elders, seeking an audience to discuss the danger the Carthaginians pose to us all, and yet no one had to decency to answer the call save the Tibulatians, who are foreigners on this island as much as the North Africans are. I expected our cousins to answer the sacred call, considering that we have many Nuragic tribes on this island, but I shouldn't be surprised that they all slink away from a war council.' Turning towards a red-faced [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetName], who is standing with arms crossed, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] extends [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] finger and continues [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] tirade, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] voice trembling in anger.\n\n'I believe that you are all cowards, unworthy to sleep with pigs! [GetCountry('X47').GetRuler.GetFirstName], you dare to come here with honeyed words promising a false peace, your breath sweetened by Carthaginian wine and your pockets flush with their silver - enough! You are no partner in war, but a serpent in the grass. Leave at once, lest I break my oath of hospitality and strike you down where you stand!' The mood in the throng turns ugly as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] screams 'There shall be no mercy shown to anyone! Sardinia will be ours!'"
 me_nuragic_01_inv_1.a:0 "Death to cowards and foreigners! We shall slay them all!"
 me_nuragic_1_tooltip:0 "#Y We now have claims on all of Sardinia#!. The mission task '#Y A Council of Great Importance#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 
 me_nuragic_2_title:0 "Securing the Reserves"
 me_nuragic_2_desc:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has arrived at the farming settlement that was just recently completed, deciding to leave nothing to chance and desiring to personally inspect the handiwork of our workers. [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] walked through the fields, inspecting the quality of the soil, and spent hours walking through the storerooms, checking the provender for the farm animals and whether or not their stalls were properly cleaned - no detail was deemed too insignificant for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention. After an incredibly long day, everyone was relieved when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] made his pronouncement."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.2.a:0 "We can prepare for what is to come, knowing our bellies will be full"
 me_nuragic_2_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Securing the Reserves#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 securing_reserves_tt:0 "Build a farming settlement in any food producing territory."

 me_nuragic_3_title:0 "Restore the Nuraghe"
 me_nuragic_3_desc:0 "For months now, we have had men working hard in the mountains, quarrying the necessary stone to repair the nuraghe fortifications in our lands. The work is grueling, and the laborers often complain mightily during the heat of the day, but all are aware that this difficult work is of utmost importance.\n\nAlthough we have full faith in the ability of our soldiers to protect our people, our minds are at ease, knowing that, if all else fails, we can gather within the walls of the nuraghe to regain our strength."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.3.a:0 "May we never have the need to retreat to these towers"
 me_nuragic_3_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Restore the Nuraghe#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_4_title:0 "The Fall of [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]"
 me_nuragic_4_desc:0 "From [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] vantage point in the nearby hills, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a commanding view of the plains below, with all eyes on the thick trail of black smoke drifting upward from [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName]. For months, the Carthaginians have known of our preparations, but in their hubris, dismissed us as mere barbarians, incapable of executing our war plans. They thought themselves safe behind their walls, but they clearly misunderstood the nature of the danger they were in.\n\nTurning to a nearby advisor, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] drily gives an order. 'Find the commander of the citadel and send his head to Carthage. Spare no one else that you find.'"
 me_nuragic_01_inv.4.a:0 "This is a message that the Carthaginians will understand..."
 me_nuragic_4_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y The First City to Fall#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_5_title:0 "Locking the Back Door"
 me_nuragic_5_desc:0 "We have finally received news that our ongoing construction at [GetProvince('(int32)3506').GetName] is almost finished, despite the harrassment of the local Tibulatians and Corsians who do not wish to see our presence in the region. Still, the soldiers at the worksite are more than capable of driving off these skirmishers, so work draws to its inevitable conclusion.\n\nAlthough the fortress at Viniolae is an impressive achievement, our chief architect has informed us that we could do more to bolster our defenses, if we have the coin to do so."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.5.a:0 "This is more than suitable for our purposes"
 me_nuragic_01_inv.5.b:0 "It's worth spending more, to prevent a calamity in the future"
 me_nuragic_5a_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Locking the Back Door#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 me_nuragic_5b_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Locking the Back Door#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_6_title:0 "A Foothold in Phikaria"
 me_nuragic_6_desc:0 "Although we have done our best to secure the northern coasts of Sardinia, we find ourselves constantly bothered by Corsian and Tibulatian raiders, who, unable to accept their defeat at our hands, have resorted to brigandry, taking by cunning and treachery what they cannot by force of arms. Erroneously believing themselves safe on the island of Corsica, we have been forced to build an outpost on the island, with hopes to harry their attempted crossing of the Mare Sardoum at the source.\n\nThe situation is fine for now, but untenable long term...we may be forced to pacify the island eventually."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.6.a:0 "Now we can keep an eye on this damned rabble"
 me_nuragic_6_tooltip:0 "We now have claims on the island of Corsica. The mission task '#Y A Foothold in Phikaria#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_7_title:0 "Eyes on the Hills"
 me_nuragic_7_desc:0 "'Get down, you fool! They are almost upon us!' [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] hisses, grabbing [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_dude3').GetName] by the tunic and pulling them towards the brush. Seconds later, a large raiding party of light cavalry gallops past the location where you were just standing - disaster was barely avoided. Giving the signal once the drumbeat of hooves has faded, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] gathers [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] soldiers and they crawl on their stomachs up the hill, watching the enemy horsemen as they head towards the coast.\n\nThe Carthaginians have doubled their patrols lately, and although they are flooding our island with silver, hiring anyone and everyone willing to stand against us, our scouts are finding the hidden places in the valleys and keeping an eye on their movements, gods be praised. With a bit of luck, we will be able to keep this advantage, especially with the aid of the mountain rebels, who know these roads like the back of their own hands."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.7.a:0 "Do your best to remain unseen - we need the element of surprise"
 me_nuragic_7_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Eyes in the Hills#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_8_title:0 "Bloody Gifts for Babai"
 me_nuragic_8_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, as the saying goes, and although our people have not sacrificed humans to the gods in many years, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that we must appeal to the gods of war and death. The air is filled with the heart-rending wailing of women and children as our soldiers drag them from the wagons and push towards the execution site. Some, casting a pitiful glance at [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] on their way to the chopping block in hopes of finding compassion, find their gaze unmet. There will be no clemency today, only the axe.\n\nOf course, our reputation at home and abroad will suffer because of this...the Carthaginians will tell everyone that we are barbarians, and point to this moment as evidence of our savagery. "
 me_nuragic_01_inv.8.a:0 "Babai will not forget this offering...the price will be worth it!"
 me_nuragic_8_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Sacrifice to the Gods of War#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_9_title:0 "The Port of Cornus"
 me_nuragic_9_desc:0 "For a long time, we have known that the settlement of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] has been an important waystation for Carthaginian merchants, who oftentimes stop at this friendly port for fresh water and supplies while traversing the pirate-haunted Mare Sardoum.\n\nNeedless to say, our recent victory there shall do much to frustrate these efforts. Oh, yes, and the treasury left behind is a nice addition to our own coffers."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.9.a:0 "Every little bit helps"
 me_nuragic_9_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y The Port of Cornus#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_10_title:0 "The Destruction of Sulki"
 me_nuragic_10_desc:0 "[GetProvince('(int32)3481').GetName], the seat of Carthaginian power on Sardinia, has fallen to the victorious forces of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and the revenge desired by our bloodthirsty soldiers is frightening. For as long as anyone can remember, the Carthaginians have terrorized our people from behind Sulki's walls, acting as if they owned the island, but now the gods have abandoned the perifidious men from North Africa and the hour of judgment is at hand.\n\nWhen [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s armies first approached Sulki, it was feared that victory would result in the hated Carthaginian capital being utterly destroyed - truthfully, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] might not be able to stop [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] men from burning the city down.\n\nBy razing this city, the soldiers believe that the crimes of their fathers would finally be avenged, a symbolic step towards purging the hateful presence of the Carthaginians from the land forevermore, but our advisors are pulling their hair out over the thought of despoiling one of our island's few cities.\n\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands before Sulki's gates, an entire army waiting for the command...with a single word, thousands of souls could perish."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.10.a:0 "Spare no tears from them;this is what they deserve. Burn it all down!"
 me_nuragic_10_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y The Sack of Sulki#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
 me_nuragic_01_inv.10.b:0 "I have changed my mind - tell the men to spare the city"
 me_nuragic_10_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y The Sack of Sulki#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_11_title:0 "Karalian Farmlands"
 me_nuragic_11_desc:0 "Over the last few weeks, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been spending more and more time in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName]. Being familiar with the entirety of Sardinia at this point, having spent most of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] adult life campaigning on the island, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is well-acquainted with practically every mountain road and valley our island contains, so it should come as no surprise that Karali has received the most attention.\n\nGood farmland has always been elusive on our island, and yet Karali is blessed with fertile fields and streams of fresh water, with plenty of room for our farm animals to wander at their will. The bees that live in the countryside produce a honey tinged with a slight bitterness that gourmands find exquisite, and the wines produced in Karali's vineyards are simply the best found on Sardinia. Not one for soft living, even the mighty [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has been captivated by the charms of the region, ordering that the city be built to exacting standards."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.11.a:0 "I envision a future here..."
 me_nuragic_11_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Karalian Farmlands#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_12_title:0 "A Southern Capital"
 me_nuragic_12_desc:0 "Having received word that the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName] is thriving, thanks to the largesse shown by [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] in funding its construction, our leader has made a bold decision, one that has shocked the Tribal Elders - we are to abandon our ancestral home immediately and migrate our capital to the new city on the coast. Although some are balking at [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s unorthodox command, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] personal popularity, as well as recent changes in our laws, have given [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the absolute authority to uproot our people's way of life, so all contrary voices have been silenced.\n\nIt is true that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] rules [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] all but in name, despite what our laws and traditions might say, so when it is announced one morning that a royal palace has been constructed in [GetProvince('(int32)3484').GetName], not many are surprised. It seems that the days of our former ways of governance, whatever they might be, are quietly over, and a new era is upon us. We only pray that the gods grant [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], first of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] name, the wisdom to shepherd our people through a violent and turbulent world.\n\nThere are some who openly mourn the loss of our ancient capital, and many others secretly mourn the loss of our ancient freedoms, yet these despondent voices are few when compared to those who are excited by this unexpected change. Life will be different for us now..."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.12.a:0 "This day truly marks the beginning of our story"
 me_nuragic_12_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y A Southern Capital#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_13_title:0 "Seize the Ships"
 me_nuragic_13_desc:0 "In their haste to abandon [GetProvince('(int32)3504').GetName], the Carthaginians left much behind - a surprising turn of affairs, considering their reputation for avarice. Not only did they abandon the city to our forces, in their blind panic they even left ships floating in the harbor, although apparently they made a half-hearted attempt to burn them before fleeing. The winds were working against them, however, and we were able to put the fires out and salvage a small number of ships.\n\nAlthough we are very inexperienced when it comes to matters of the sea, our engineers have repaired these vessels to the best of their ability, and it appears we now have a small navy, o [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.13.a:0 "A navy, you say? This is certainly unexpected"
 me_nuragic_13_tooltip:0 "The mission task '#Y Seize the Ships#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"

 me_nuragic_14_title:0 "A Blind Eye to Piracy"
 me_nuragic_14_desc:0 "'Cousin! The gods treat you well!'\n\nAt these words, a bright smile lights up [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s face. Crossing the deck of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] flagship, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] greets the leader of the Pirates of Mago, who has answered our call and has agreed to hear what we are proposing. It is certainly a strange sight to witness, as the Pirates have sailed their fleet just outside of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName], where [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] agreed to go out and meet them at sea.\n\nAlthough our tribes split from each other hundreds of years ago, our people have maintained a tenuous connection to our Talaiotic kinsmen, who live on the islands far to the West. It is there, in the Balearides, that the dread Pirates of Mago have established themselves, preying upon the rich trade routes connecting Iberia and Carthage. Piracy is a lucrative business to be in, and [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has decided that we want in on the glorious racket.\n\n'As you can see, we have built everything one could need here, but we are wanting for people...the wars have been hard on us. Say the word, and we will open our port to you and your men.' "

 me_nuragic_15_title:0 "Slaves In Our Own Homeland"
 me_nuragic_15_desc:0 "Long ago, our people, proud Nuragic tribesmen, lived in a state of harmony with our neighbors; simple yet honorable folk, we were content to graze our animals on the mountainsides and watch our grandchildren grow old. Some might find this state of existence to be a sorry one, but we were grateful to the gods for the kindnesses they bestowed upon us.\n\nAll of this changed with the arrival of the foreigners - first the Carthaginians came, circumnavigating our island in their vast fleets and taking the best land for themselves, setting up their strongholds in the south, only to be followed by Corsian tribesmen from the north, who grew tired of crossing the waters to raid us and built permanent camps. These strangers, unfamiliar with our ways, had no interest in co-existing, driving our people out of their ancestral lands and deep into the interior of the island. Unable or unwilling to fight back, we abandoned our homes and fled to the safety of the mountains.\n\nLately, the Carthaginians, emboldened by the mistakes our fathers made in refusing to stand against them, have been sending their tax collectors into our towns and villages. Whenever any of our people complain at this grave injustice, they are beaten, or worse, killed. Just the other day, Carthaginian agents, acting with impunity, strangled an old man to death right in front of our Tribal Chief, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], because he tried to withhold a few copper coins. Clearly, they think little to nothing of us, and it is only a matter of time before they conquer us outright."
 me_nuragic_01_inv.15.a:0 "I, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], can bear this no longer..."
 me_nuragic_15_tooltip:0 "How long can this state of affairs go on?"

 me_nuragic_16_title:0 "Stale Guests"
 me_nuragic_16_desc:0 "It is rare for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to acknowledge when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has made a mistake, but, with each passing day, it looks like welcoming the Pirates of [GetProvince('(int32)1469').GetName] to set up shop in our province of [GetProvince('(int32)3494').GetName] was a terrible, terrible idea. While it is true that we have gained from the arrangement, sharing in the plunder that the pirates bring back to port, the hassle of dealing with these raiders is starting to outweigh the benefits. The Talaiotic pirates have no respect for our customs and treat our people as annoyances, demanding special privileges, like free room and board in the city, and are generally making themselves into drunken nuisances. The locals of Cornus are constantly submitting petitions, accusing the pirates of being worse than the Carthaginians and asking that something be done about them.
