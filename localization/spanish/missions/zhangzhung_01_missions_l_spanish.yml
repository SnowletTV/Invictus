01_zhangzhung_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "In the most distant places of the world, where the ground turns into mighty mountains that reach up and seem to touch the very sky itself - this is the land where you will find our people, who have lived in the clefts of the hills and rocks since the the beginning of Time. There are few hearty enough to venture into our homelands, for the journey is difficult, but there are plenty of traders who risk their lives navigating the valleys and mountain passes in our territory, for we sit on the crossroads of many powerful and wealthy nations.\n\nThe time has come for us, too, to become powerful and wealthy."
01_zhangzhung_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have created a kingdom in the mountains - we must find a leader who can protect our people and lead the adherents of the Bon Faith into a glorious future."

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "Building a magnificent holy site in our capital city would prove to the world that our Bon faith guides every step of our movements.

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Feeding the empty stomachs of our citizens has always been a difficult task, no doubt due to the lack of suitable land for growing crops. This cannot be an excuse for any longer, however; we must take steps to increase the available foodstuffs available for our people. Why not take advantage of our terrain?

01_zhangzhung_missions_task_23_DESC:0 "We cannot tolerate a porous border, but must take the steps required to secure the mountain passes. But what good are the best of fortifications if the people themselves are not united? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil6!"

Still, with careful planning, the worst of this can be mitigated, especially if you have a leader as conscientious as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is. Although spending money on farms is not popular when budgets are tight, everyone certainly enjoys a loaf of freshly-baked bread straight from the oven - a treat that all will get to enjoy more frequently, now that we have expanded our storage capacity by ingeniously building granaries in the mountains themselves. We truly have a visionary leader guiding our nation forward."

Although we laugh when we hear these stories, we extend an invitation to anyone that wishes to visit the so-called 'Mountain Kingdom' for themselves, as some have taken to calling our country. You will soon see that we are as civilized as many other countries, and our cities can offer delights to the traveler that will rival anything you will find in the storied capitals of the great kingdoms."
